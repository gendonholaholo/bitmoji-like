    "description": "# API Document\nLast modified: Dec. 10, 2025 a99a8b6\n\nThe YouCam Online Editor AI APIs are series of AI effects that let you beautify your photos, as well as generate amazing aesthetic creations beyond human imagination. Let the magic begin.\n\nPLEASE NOTE that by reading this API documentation, or by setting up code pursuant to the instructions in this API documentation, you acknowledge it adheres to Perfect Corp's [Privacy policy](https://www.makeupar.com/youcamapps/youcam/privacy-policy.html), and [Terms of Service](https://www.makeupar.com/perfectbeauty/youcam/terms-of-service). And If you have any issue, please contact: [YouCamOnlineEditor_API@perfectcorp.com](mailto:YouCamOnlineEditor_API@perfectcorp.com)\n\n\n![YouCam Online Editor AI APIs](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/strapi/assets/YCO_AI_API.png \"YouCam Online Editor AI APIs\")\n\n## Introduction\n[YouCam Online Editor](https://yce.makeupar.com/) is a powerful and easy-to-use AI platform that provides beautiful and true-to-life visual effects thanks to the latest AI technology. This API document will briefly introduce how to integrate these awesome AI effects into your business. YouCam Online Editor AI APIs are standard RESTful APIs to let you easily integrate to your website, e-commerce platforms, iOS/Android APP, applets, mini-programs, and more.\n\n![YouCam Online Editor AI APIs](https://d3anovxlgi5hpq.cloudfront.net/assets/images/aiApi/banner/yce-topbanner-dt.png \"YouCam Online Editor AI APIs\")\n\n## API Server\nThe YouCam Online Editor AI APIs are built on top of RESTful web APIs. The API server is the host of all APIs. Once you complete the authentication, you can start your AI tasks through the API Server.\n- ### YouCam Online Editor AI API server:\n    https://yce-api-01.makeupar.com\n\n## Rate Limit\nTo ensure fair usage and prevent abuse, our API implements rate limiting. There are two types of rate limits:\n\n- ### Per IP Address\n    Each IP address is allowed a maximum of 250 requests per 300 seconds with 5 queries per second(QPS). If this limit is exceeded, subsequent requests will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` error.\n\n- ### Per Access Token\n    Each access token is allowed a maximum of 250 requests per 300 seconds with 5 queries per second(QPS). If this limit is exceeded, subsequent requests will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` error.\n\nBoth conditions must be met for a request to be accepted. If either condition is not met, the request will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` error. Please note that each query related to unit will be processed real-time. Other APIs can use the access token util expired.\n\nIt is recommended that you handle rate limit errors gracefully in your application by implementing the appropriate backoff and retry mechanisms.\n\n\n## File Retention Period\n**V2 API**\nAny files you upload are stored on our server for **24 hours**, and then they're automatically deleted.\nProcessed results are retained for **24 hours** after completion.\n\n**V1 API**\nAny files you upload are stored on our server for one day, and then they're automatically deleted. Files created by the system – the results you get – we keep those for 7 days before they're automatically removed.\n\n> **Warning:** Even though those result files are still good for 7 days, the link to download them might only be active for about two hours after they're created. If that download link expires, you can still access the file using its file ID – you can use that ID with another feature to get it.\n\n\n## Supported Formats & Dimensions\n|AI Photo Editing|Supported Dimensions|Supported File Size|Supported Formats|\n|  ----  | ----  | ----  | ----  |\n|AI Photo Enhance|Input: long side <= 4096, Output: long side <= 4096|< 10MB|jpg/jpeg/png|\n|AI Photo Colorize|Input: long side <= 4096, Output: long side <= 4096|< 10MB|jpg/jpeg/png|\n|AI Photo Color Correction|Input: long side <= 4096, Output: long side <= 4096|< 10MB|jpg/jpeg/png|\n|AI Photo Lighting|4096x4096 (long side <= 4096, short side >= 256)|< 10MB|jpg/jpeg/png|\n|AI Image Extender|Input: long side <= 4096, Output: short side <= 1024, long side <= 2048|< 10MB|jpg/jpeg/png|\n|AI Replace|Input: long side <= 4096, Output: short side <= 1024, long side <= 2048|< 10MB|jpg/jpeg/png|\n|AI Object Removal|Input: long side <= 4096, Output: long side <= 4096|< 10MB|jpg/jpeg/png|\n|AI Image Generator|Input: long side <= 4096, Output: long side <= 1024|< 10MB|jpg/jpeg/png|\n|Al Photo Background Removal|Input: long side <= 4096, Output: long side <= 4096|< 10MB|jpg/jpeg/png|\n|AI Photo Background Blur|Input: long side <= 4096, Output: long side <= 4096|< 10MB|jpg/jpeg/png|\n|AI Photo Background Change|Input: long side <= 4096, Output: long side <= 4096|< 10MB|jpg/jpeg/png|\n\n|AI Portrait|Supported Dimensions|Supported File Size|Supported Formats|\n|  ----  | ----  | ----  | ----  |\n|AI Avatar Generator|Input: long side <= 4096, Output: long side <= 1024|< 10MB|jpg/jpeg/png|\n|AI Face Swap|4096x4096 (long side <= 4096), single face only, need to show full face|< 10MB|jpg/jpeg/png|\n\n|AI Video Editing|Supported Dimensions|Supported File Size|Supported Formats|\n|  ----  | ----  | ----  | ----  |\n|AI Video Enhance|input: long side <= 1920; output: max 2x input resolution, up to 60 sec, 30 FPS, 8 bit|<100MB|container: mov, mp4; video codec: MPEG-4, H.264 AVC; audio codec: aac, mp3;|\n|AI Video Face Swap|input: long side <= 4096; output: 1280x720, 30 FPS, up to 30 sec, 8 bit, single face only|<100MB|container: mov, mp4; video codec: MPEG-4, H.264 AVC; audio codec: aac, mp3|\n|AI Video Style Transfer|input: long side <= 4096; output: long side <= 1280, 16 FPS, up to 30 sec, 8 bit|<100MB|container: mov, mp4; video codec: MPEG-4, H.264 AVC; audio codec: aac, mp3|\n\n## Error Codes\n- Successful responses (100 - 399)\n- Client error responses (400 - 499)\n- Server error response (500 - 599)\n\n| General Error Code | Description |\n| ------------------ | ----------- |\n| exceed_max_filesize | The input file size exceeds the maximum limit |\n| invalid_parameter | The parameter value is invalid |\n| error_download_image | There was an error downloading the source image |\n| error_download_mask | There was an error downloading the mask image |\n| error_decode_image | There was an error decoding the source image |\n| error_decode_mask | There was an error decoding the mask image |\n| error_download_video | There was an error downloading the source video |\n| error_decode_video | There was an error decoding the source video |\n| error_nsfw_content_detected | NSFW content was detected in the source image |\n| error_no_face | No face was detected in the source image |\n| error_pose | Failed to detect pose in the source image |\n| error_face_parsing | Failed to perform face parsing on the source image |\n| error_inference | An error occurred in the inference pipeline |\n| exceed_nsfw_retry_limits | Retry limits exceeded to avoid generating NSFW image |\n| error_upload | There was an error uploading the result image |\n| error_multiple_people | Multiple people were detected in the source image |\n| error_no_shoulder | Shoulders are not visible in the source image |\n| error_large_face_angle | The face angle in the uploaded image is too large |\n| error_hair_too_short | The input hair is too short |\n| error_unexpected_video_duration | The video duration does not match the expected duration |\n| error_bald_image | The input hairstyle is bald |\n| error_unsupport_ratio | The aspect ratio of the input image is unsupported |\n| unknown_internal_error | Other internal errors |\n\n---\n\n# Quick Start Guide\nFirst, you need to register a YouCam Online Editor account for free at [https://yce.makeupar.com/](https://yce.makeupar.com/). You can then purchase or subscribe to get your units to use the service. You can see your subscription plan, pay as you go units, and your usage record at [https://yce.makeupar.com/api-console/en/api-keys/](https://yce.makeupar.com/api-console/en/api-keys/). You can go to the API Key tab under your account page to generate and maintain your API keys to start using the YouCam Online Editor AI APIs.\n\n\n## V2 API\n\n### **Overview**\nStarting from **API version v1.5**, we have introduced a **simplified V2 API** to streamline integration processes.\n\n**Scope:**\n- **Skin V2 API**\n    - AI Skin Analysis\n    - AI Aging Generator\n    - AI Skin Tone Analysis\n    - AI Face Analyzer\n- **Beauty V2 API**\n    - AI Makeup Virtual Try On\n    - AI Look Virtual Try On\n- **Fashion V2 API**\n    - AI Clothes\n    - AI Fabric\n- **Hair V2 API**\n    - AI Hair Color\n    - AI Hairstyle Generator\n    - AI Hair Extension\n    - AI Hair Bang Generator\n    - AI Hair Volume Generator\n    - AI Wavy Hair\n    - AI Hair Length Detection\n    - AI Hair Type Detection\n    - AI Hair Frizziness Detection\n    - AI Beard Style Generator\n> **Note:** V2 API is designed for workflow simplification only. It does not introduce advanced functionality. Both V1 APIs and V2 APIs use the same underlying AI models.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Changes in V2 API**\n\n#### **1. Endpoint Reduction**\n- **V1 API Endpoints:**\n  - `POST /v1.0/client/auth` – Authentication\n  - `POST /v1.1/file/ai-task` – Upload a file\n  - `POST /v1.0/task/ai-task` – Run an AI task\n  - `GET /v1.0/task/ai-task` – Get the result\n\n- **V2 API Endpoints:**\n  - `POST /v2.0/file/ai-task` – Upload a file or provide a file URL\n  - `POST /v2.0/task/ai-task` – Run an AI task\n  - `GET /v2.0/task/ai-task` – Get the result\n\n#### **2. Authentication**\n- **V1 API:** Requires explicit call to Authentication endpoint.- **V2 API:** No separate authentication endpoint.  - Include your API key in the request header using **Bearer Token**:\n    ```\n    Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\n    ```\nYou can find your API Key at https://yce.makeupar.com/api-console/en/api-keys/.\n\n#### **3. Image Input**\n- Supports **both file upload and file URL** as input sources.\n\n#### **4. Polling Mechanism**\n- Processed results are retained for **24 hours** after completion.\n- No need for short-interval polling.\n- Flexible polling intervals within the 24-hour window.\n- **Important:** Polling is still required to check task status, as execution time is not guaranteed.\n\n#### **5. JSON Structure Simplification**\n- **List Style API** now uses a simplified JSON parameter structure.\n  - AI Hairstyle Generator: https://yce-api-01.makeupar.com/s2s/v2.0/task/template/hair-style\n  - AI Clothes: https://yce-api-01.makeupar.com/s2s/v2.0/task/template/cloth\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n- **V2 API = Simplified workflow, same AI models.**- Reduced endpoints, easier authentication, flexible input options, improved polling, and cleaner JSON.\n\n---\n\n## V1 API\nTo complete the authentication and start using the AI APIs, you need:\n1. Go to https://yce.makeupar.com/api-console/en/api-keys/ and create the API Key.\n\n1. Upon creation is completed, it will show the API Key and the Secret key. Where your API Key is the ***client_id*** and the Secret key is the ***client_secret*** in this document to complete the authentication process.\n\n    <img src=\"https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/API_Key_59eca16942.png\">\n\n    > **Warning:** Please kindly note that your Secret key can only be copied at step #2. Once the dialog is closed, there is no method to obtain the Secret key again unless create an another API Key.\n\n1. To obtain id_token, you need to follow the method below and convert client_secret into id_token\n\n    Encrypt\n    > **client_id=\\<client_id\\>&timestamp=\\<timestamp in millisecond\\>**\n\n    with RSA X.509 format Base64 encoded client_secret to obtain id_token\n\n    JavaScript sample:\n    ```javascript\n    let encrypt = new JSEncrypt();\n    encrypt.setPublicKey(client_secret);\n    let encrypted = encrypt.encrypt(\n    `client_id=${client_id}&timestamp=${new Date().getTime()}`\n    );\n    console.log(encrypted);\n    ```\n\n    PHP sample:\n    ```php\n    <?php\n    class RSAPublicEncryption {\n        private $publicKey;\n\n        public function __construct($rawPublicKey) {\n            $pemKey = \"-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\\n\" .\n                    chunk_split($rawPublicKey, 64, \"\\n\") .\n                    \"-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\";\n\n            $this->publicKey = openssl_pkey_get_public($pemKey);\n            if ($this->publicKey === false) {\n                throw new Exception('Invalid public key');\n            }\n        }\n\n        public function encrypt($data) {\n            $encrypted = '';\n            $result = openssl_public_encrypt($data, $encrypted, $this->publicKey);\n            if ($result === false) {\n                throw new Exception('Encryption failed');\n            }\n            return base64_encode($encrypted);\n        }\n    }\n\n    try {\n        $rawPublicKey = \"<client_secret>\";\n\n        $rsa = new RSAPublicEncryption($rawPublicKey);\n\n        $data = \"client_id=<client_id>&timestamp=<timestamp in millisecond>\";\n\n        $encrypted = $rsa->encrypt($data);\n        echo \"Encrypted: \" . $encrypted . \"\\n\";\n\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        echo \"Error: \" . $e->getMessage();\n    }\n    ?>\n    ```\n\n1. Calling the authentication API to obtain the ***access_token*** to start using the YouCam Online Editor AI APIs.\n\nPlease note that your units will be consumed when the resulting image was successfully generated. You may refer to [the AI API page](https://yce.makeupar.com/ai-api) regarding the price of each task and how to obtain units.\n\n---\n### V1 API AI Task Execution Workflow and Style Querying APIs\nWe support three categories of AI tasks:\n\n- **Direct Execution Tasks**</BR>\nThese tasks operate directly on user input without additional configuration. Examples include AI Photo Enhance and AI Image Extender.\n\n- **Style-Based Tasks**</BR>\nThese require an initial style selection before execution. Examples include AI Hairstyles Try-On, AI Studio Generator, and AI Clothes Try-On.</BR>\n    There are two ways to retrieve styles for these tasks:\n    - Version 1.0\n        - v1.0/task/style-group/{feature}: Lists style groups.\n        - v1.0/task/style/{feature}: Fetches styles within the selected group.\n    - Version 1.1\n        - v1.1/task/style/{feature}: Retrieves styles categorized by predefined groups. If no category_id is specified, the response includes either styles or subcategories. Single-layer categories contain only styles, while multi-layer categories include subcategories. To explore a subcategory, provide its ID as category_id and query the endpoint again.\n\n- **Preprocessing-Required Tasks**</BR>\nThese tasks require an initial detection step before execution. For example, AI Face Swap needs a face detection task to identify faces in the input. After detection, you can specify which face to swap in the main AI task.\n\n---\n### V1 API Integration Guide - Direct Execution Tasks\nNow, let's consider an example usage flow of an ***AI Photo Enhance*** API calling sequence.\n\n1. **Upload file using the File API**</BR>\nAfter successfully authorizing and getting the access_token, you can call 'file/enhance' to acquire the upload URL and a File ID associated with it.\nIt will give you a URL – use that URL to upload your file. Once the upload is finished, you can use the file_id from the same response to start using our AI features.\n\n2. **Run an AI task to obtain it's task_id**</BR>\nSubsequently, calling POST 'task/enhance' with the\nFile ID executes the enhance task and obtains a ***task_id***.\n\n3. **Polling to check the status of a task until it succeed or error**</BR>\nThis ***task_id*** is used to monitor the task's status through polling GET 'task/enhance' to retrieve the current engine status. Until the engine completes the task, the status will remain 'running', and no units will be consumed during this stage.\n\n    **Warning:** Please note that, **Polling** to check the status of a task based on it's ***polling_interval*** is mandotary. A task will be timed out if there is no polling request within the ***polling_interval***, even if the task is processed succefully(Your unit(s) will be consumed).\n\n    > **Warning:** You will get a ***InvalidTaskId*** error once you check the status of a timed out task. So, once you run an AI task, you need to **polling** to check the status within the ***polling_interval*** until the status become either *success* or *error*.\n\n4. **Get the result of an AI task once success**</BR>\nThe task will change to the 'success' status after the engine successfully processes your input file and generates the resulting image. You will get an url of the processed image and a dst_id that allow you to chain another AI task without re-upload the result image.\nYour units will only be consumed in this case. If the engine fails to process the task, the task's status will change to 'error' and no unit will be consumed.</BR>\nWhen deducting units, the system will prioritize those nearing expiration. If the expiration date is the same, it will deduct the units obtained on the earliest date.\n\n### V1 API Integration Guide - Style-Based Tasks\nNow, let's consider an example usage flow of an ***AI Clothes*** API calling sequence to try on predefined outfit styles.\n\n1. **Upload file using the File API**</br>\n  Using the ***v1.1/file/cloth*** API to upload a target user image.\n    - Image Requirements\n      - See details in **[File Specs & Errors](#tag/AI-Clothes/File-Specs-and-Errors)**.\n    - Upload a full body photo of yourself. The virtual outfit changer works best with high resolution photos that show your clothes clearly. The photo background should not have too many people or distracting objects.\n\n2. **List Predefined Outfit Styles**</br>\n  There are two ways to list outfits for AI Clothes virtual try-on:\n    - ***v1.0/task/style-group/cloth*** and ***v1.0/task/style/cloth***: Retrieve style groups first, then fetch styles within the chosen group.\n    - ***v1.1/task/style/cloth***: Fetch a predefined style list by category. If you don’t specify a category_id, each category will contain either styles or subcategories. Categories with a single layer only include styles, while multi-layered categories will have subcategories. To explore a subcategory, pass its ID as category_id and call the list again.\n\n3. **Run an AI task to obtain it's task_id**</br>\n  Execute AI task ***v1.0/task/cloth*** with the clothing image file_id as ref_ids and the target user image file_id as src_ids.\n\n4. **Polling to check the status of a task until it succeed or error**</br>\n  This ***task_id*** is used to monitor the task's status through polling GET 'v1.0/task/cloth' to retrieve the current engine status. Until the engine completes the task, the status will remain 'running', and no units will be consumed during this stage.\n\n      **Warning:** Please note that, **Polling** to check the status of a task based on it's ***polling_interval*** is mandotary. A task will be timed out if there is no polling request within the ***polling_interval***, even if the task is processed succefully(Your unit(s) will be consumed).\n\n      > **Warning:** You will get a ***InvalidTaskId*** error once you check the status of a timed out task. So, once you run an AI task, you need to **polling** to check the status within the ***polling_interval*** until the status become either *success* or *error*.\n\n5. **Get the result of an AI task once success**</br>\n  The task will change to the 'success' status after the engine successfully processes your input file and generates the resulting image. You will get an url of the processed image and a dst_id that allow you to chain another AI task without re-upload the result image.</br> Your units will only be consumed in this case. If the engine fails to process the task, the task's status will change to 'error' and no unit will be consumed.</br> When deducting units, the system will prioritize those nearing expiration. If the expiration date is the same, it will deduct the units obtained on the earliest date.\n\n---\n# FAQ\n## Q&A Hub\n1. **Q: What does 'Unit' mean, and how is it used?**\n    </br>**A:** Please note that credits are exclusively used within the YouCam Online Editor UI, whereas units are designated solely for AI API usage. Throughout this document, all references to 'credit' or 'unit' pertain to the Unit.\n    </br>\n    Please check the page https://yce.makeupar.com/ai-api for details on how many units each AI feature consumes.\n    </br></br>\n\n1. **Q: Why am I getting InvalidTaskId error?**\n    </br>**A:** You will get a ***InvalidTaskId*** error once you check the status of a timed out task. So, once you run an AI task, you need to **polling** to check the status within the ***polling_interval*** until the status become either *success* or *error*.\n    </br></br>\n\n1. **Q: What is client_id, client_secret and id_token?**\n    </br>**A:** Your API Key is the ***client_id*** and the Secret key is the ***client_secret***. And please follow the Quick start guide to get the ***id_token*** to complete the authentication process.\n\n    For more information and questions, please refer to our [blog page](https://www.makeupar.com/consumer/blog) and the [FAQ page](https://yce.makeupar.com/faq).

Our customer success team are very happy to help. ;)\n    </br></br>\n\n1. **Q: How to uplaod an image through curl?**\n    </br>**A:** curl --location --request PUT '{url_api_response}' --header '{headers_in_api_response}' --data-binary @'{local_file_path}'\n    ```\n    curl --location --request PUT 'https://yce-us.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/ttl30/320554715144259928/77022501909/v2/aeMNNB0KmUIP8rnQ996tC5Q/49c9f5cb-882c-41d9-a435-73b951cdf018.jpg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20250507T110821Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=content-length%3Bcontent-type%3Bhost&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARB77EV5Y5D7DAE3S%2F20250507%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=efaeed8fd3da03be0f0c9ed1274325651ef2adffb51321cc489f6baa4a80e394' --header 'Content-Type: image/jpg' --header 'Content-Length: 50000'  --data-binary @'./test.jpg'\n    ```\n    </br></br>\n\n1. **Q: What platforms does the AI API support? Can it be used on mobile devices?**\n    </br>**A:** The AI API works seamlessly across different platforms. Since it's built on a standard RESTful API, you can use it for server-to-server communication, on mobile devices, or in a web browser - whatever best fits your needs.\n    </br></br>\n\n1. **Q: Is it possible to use the AI API with Flutter on both Android and iOS?**\n    </br>**A:**\n        Absolutely. Since AI APIs are standard RESTful APIs, you can access them using Flutter's built-in HTTP APIs to make requests.\n\n    Here are some official Flutter documents on making network queries.\n    * https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/networking/fetch-data\n    * https://pub.dev/packages/http\n\n    And here’s a simple way to call a http GET with Bearer Authentication using Flutter’s http package:\n    ```dart\n    import 'dart:convert';\n    import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;\n\n    Future<void> fetchData() async {\n        String token = \"your_bearer_token_here\"; // Replace with your actual token\n\n        final response = await http.get(\n            Uri.parse(\"https://yce-api-01.makeupar.com/s2s/v1.0/task/ai-task\"),\n            headers: {\n            \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n            \"Authorization\": \"Bearer $token\",\n            },\n        );\n\n        if (response.statusCode == 200) {\n            print(\"Data fetched successfully: ${response.body}\");\n        } else {\n            print(\"Failed to fetch data: ${response.statusCode}\");\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n    Key Steps to Auth:\n    - Retrieve the Token – You can store and retrieve the token using SharedPreferences or another secure storage method.\n    - Include the Token in Headers – Use \"Authorization\": \"Bearer $token\" in the request headers.\n    - Handle Expired Tokens – If the API returns a 401 InvalidAccessToken error, refresh the token if needed.\n    </br></br>\n\n1. **Q: API key is the API key,  Where can I find the secret key?**\n    </br>**A:** The secret key is created only when you first generate it. So make sure to save it right away, you won't be able to see it again later.\n    </br></br>\n\n1. **Q: Is it possible to integrate AI APIs into your website using Wix?**\n    </br>**A:** We do not currently have an official integration guide for using AI APIs with Wix. However, the RESTful API itself does not impose any restrictions on the platform, provided it supports standard web queries.\n\n    We strongly recommend to begin by reading the official documentation provided by Wix: https://dev.wix.com/docs/develop-websites/articles/get-started/integrate-with-3rd-parties\n\n    Wix offers several methods for integrating with third-party APIs, primarily through its Velo development platform:\n\n    * Fetch API:\n    This is the most common method and an implementation of the standard JavaScript Fetch API. It allows you to make HTTP requests to external APIs from your Wix site's frontend or backend code.\n        Backend calls: Recommended for security (especially for APIs requiring keys) and to avoid CORS issues. Use the Secrets Manager to securely store API keys.\n        Frontend calls: Possible but less secure and may encounter CORS restrictions.\n\n    * npm Packages:\n    Velo supports the use of approved npm packages, allowing you to leverage a wide array of prebuilt JavaScript modules to extend your site's functionality with third-party features.\n\n    * Service Plugins (formerly SPIs/Custom Extensions):\n    These enable you to inject custom logic or integrate third-party services directly into Wix's business solutions (e.g., Wix Stores, Wix Bookings). Service plugins allow you to customize specific parts of existing app flows or integrate external services for functionalities like custom shipping rates, dynamic pricing, or alternative payment providers.\n\n    * HTTP Functions:\n    You can expose your site's functionality as an API, allowing third-party services to call your Wix site''s backend functions and interact with your site's data or logic.\n\n    Steps for Integration (using Fetch API as an example):\n\n    * Store API Keys: If the third-party API requires authentication, store sensitive credentials like API keys securely in Wix's Secrets Manager.\n    Import wix-fetch: In your Velo backend or frontend code, import the wixFetch module.\n\n        ```JavaScript\n        import { fetch } from 'wix-fetch';\n        ```\n\n    * Make API Calls: Use the fetch function to send requests to the third-party API, including necessary headers and body data.\n\n        ```JavaScript\n        export async function getWeatherData() {\n            const apiKey = await getSecret(\"yourApiKeyName\"); // Retrieve from Secrets Manager\n            const response = await fetch(`https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=${apiKey}&q=London`, {\n                method: 'GET',\n                headers: {\n                    'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n                }\n            });\n            const data = await response.json();\n            return data;\n        }\n        ```\n\n    * Handle Responses: Process the data received from the API and integrate it into your site's design or functionality.\n    </br></br>\n\n1. **Q: Is it possible to integrate AI APIs into WooCommerce?**\n    </br>**A:** We do not currently have an official integration guide for using AI APIs with WooCommerce. However, the RESTful API itself does not impose any restrictions on the platform, provided it supports standard web queries.\n\n    We strongly recommend to begin by reading the official documentation provided by WooCommerce: https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-rest-api/\n\n    Integrating third-party APIs with WooCommerce enhances store functionality and streamlines operations. This can be achieved through various methods:\n\n    * Utilizing WooCommerce REST API:\n\n        WooCommerce provides a robust REST API that allows external applications to interact with your store data.\n        You can create API keys with specific permissions (Read, Write, or Read/Write) in WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced > REST API.\n        This enables you to automate tasks like inventory syncing, order processing, customer data synchronization, and more, by building custom integrations or using third-party services that leverage this API.\n\n    * Employing Plugins:\n\n        Many WordPress and WooCommerce plugins are designed specifically for integrating with popular third-party services like payment gateways, shipping carriers, CRM systems, and accounting software.\n        Plugins often offer pre-built integrations, simplifying the setup process and reducing the need for custom coding.\n        Examples include plugins for specific payment processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal), shipping solutions (e.g., FedEx, USPS), or general API integration tools like WPGet API.\n\n    * Custom Code and Webhooks:\n\n        For unique integration needs or when a suitable plugin isn't available, you can implement custom code within your WordPress theme or a custom plugin.\n        This involves using WordPress/WooCommerce hooks and filters to trigger API calls at specific events (e.g., woocommerce_payment_complete for post-purchase actions).\n        Webhooks can also be used to send real-time data from WooCommerce to a third-party service when certain events occur (e.g., new order, product update).\n    </br></br>\n\n## Debugging Guide\n1. **Invalid TaskId Error**\n    </br>**Why:** You’ll receive an InvalidTaskId error if you attempt to check the status of a task that has timed out. Therefore, once an AI task is initiated, you’ll need to poll for its status within the polling_interval until the status changes to either success or error.\n    </br>**Solution:** To avoid the task becoming invalid, it’s necessary to implement a timed loop that queries the task status at regular intervals within the allowed polling window.\n\n1. **500 Server Error / unknown_internal_error**\n    </br>**A:** ***Important***: Simply calling the File API does not upload your file. You must manually upload the file to the URL provided in the File API response. That URL is your upload destination, make sure the file is successfully transferred there before proceeding.<br>\n    Before calling the AI API, ensure your file has been successfully uploaded. Use the File API to retrieve an upload URL, then upload your file to that location. Once the upload is complete, you'll receive a ***file_id*** in the response, this ID is what you'll use to access AI features related to that file.\n    </br></br>\n\n1. **404 Not Found error when using AI APIs**\n    </br>**A:** ***Important***: Simply calling the File API does not upload your file. You must manually upload the file to the URL provided in the File API response. That URL is your upload destination, make sure the file is successfully transferred there before proceeding.<br>\n    Before calling the AI API, ensure your file has been successfully uploaded. Use the File API to retrieve an upload URL, then upload your file to that location. Once the upload is complete, you'll receive a ***file_id*** in the response, this ID is what you'll use to access AI features related to that file.\n    </br></br>\n\n1. **The API response returns the same style ID on the Postman**\n    </br>**A:** The is because Postman (Pretty view) and Chrome use JavaScript to parse JSON responses. In JavaScript, numbers larger than 9007199254740991 (2^53-1) cannot be represented precisely. They are rounded to the nearest representable value, which makes different IDs appear identical (e.g., 219691778809271815 → 219691778809271800).</br>\n    * Precision Loss in JavaScript/JSON Error Handling\n      * Cause: JavaScript's Number type cannot safely handle integers beyond 2^53 - 1, leading to silent truncation or rounding.\n      * Solution: Use a JSON parser like ***json-bigint*** to treat IDs as strings and retain full precision.\n    </br></br>\n\n1. **Beard Authentication 400 Error**\n    </br>**A:** When using the V2 API, you must include your API key in every request by adding a Bearer authorization header. Failure to do so will result in authentication errors.\n    **Valid Request Header Format**\n    ```\n    Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\n    ```\n    **Common Issues**\n\n    1.  **Missing Bearer Prefix**\n        The `Authorization` header must start with `Bearer` followed by the API key.\n        Example:\n        ```\n        Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY\n        ```\n\n    1.  **Unnecessary Characters**\n        Do not include angle brackets `<` or `>` around the API key. These characters are not required and will cause the request to fail.\n        Example:\n        ```\n        Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>\n        ```\n\n    2.  **Incorrect API Key**\n        Ensure that the API key provided in the `Authorization` header is correct and active.\n"

      "description": "### AI Face Swap\nUsing AI Face Swap for hyper-realistic effect with multiple faces supported.​ Our face swap artificial intelligence supports swapping one or multiple faces. Either for creating funny pictures of faces, or need a professional tool, we've got you covered.\n\n## Integration Guide\n### How to implement AI Face Swap\n#### Step 1: Obtain credentials\n\n* You need a **Client ID (Your API Key)** and **RSA public key (Your Secret Key)** from the [API Console](https://yce.makeupar.com/api-console/en/account-settings/)\n.\n* These are used to generate an encrypted ID token for authentication.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 2: Authenticate and get an access token\n\n1. Construct a string containing your client ID and a current timestamp.\n\n   ```\n   client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&timestamp=UNIX_TIMESTAMP\n   ```\n2. Encrypt this string with your RSA public key.\n3. Send a request to:\n\n   ```\n   POST https://yce-api-01.makeupar.com/s2s/v1.0/client/auth\n   Content-Type: application/json\n   ```\n\n   Body:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"client_id\": \"YOUR_CLIENT_ID\",\n     \"id_token\": \"ENCRYPTED_STRING\"\n   }\n   ```\n4. The response contains an **access_token**. Keep it safe, as you will need it for subsequent calls.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 3: Upload source and reference images\n\n1. Request upload URLs from the API:\n\n   ```\n   POST https://yce-api-01.makeupar.com/s2s/v1.1/file/face-swap\n   Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN\n   Content-Type: application/json\n   ```\n\n   Body:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"files\": [\n       {\n         \"file_name\": \"target.jpg\",\n         \"file_size\": 123456,\n         \"content_type\": \"image/jpeg\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n2. The response provides a pre-signed upload URL and a `file_id`.\n3. Upload your file with an HTTP PUT request to the given URL.\n4. Store the `file_id` for later use. Repeat this for both **target** and **reference** images.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 4: Pre-process the target image (face detection)\n\n1. Create a pre-process task:\n\n   ```\n   POST https://yce-api-01.makeupar.com/s2s/v1.0/task/face-swap/pre-process\n   Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN\n   Content-Type: application/json\n   ```\n\n   Body:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"request_id\": 1,\n     \"payload\": {\n       \"file_sets\": {\n         \"src_ids\": [\"TARGET_FILE_ID\"]\n       },\n       \"actions\": [\n         { \"id\": 0 }\n       ]\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n2. The API returns a `task_id`.\n3. Poll task status at:\n\n   ```\n   GET https://yce-api-01.makeupar.com/s2s/v1.0/task/face-swap/pre-process?task_id=TASK_ID\n   ```\n4. When finished, you receive a list of detected faces with bounding boxes.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 5: Run the face swap task\n\n1. Build a **face mapping** array. For each detected face:\n\n   * If you want to ***swap it***, set `{ \"index\": 0, \"position\": 0 }`.\n   * If you want to ***keep it unchanged***, set `{ \"index\": -1, \"position\": -1 }`.\n2. Send the main task request:\n\n   ```\n   POST https://yce-api-01.makeupar.com/s2s/v1.0/task/face-swap\n   Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN\n   Content-Type: application/json\n   ```\n\n   Body:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"request_id\": 2,\n     \"payload\": {\n       \"file_sets\": {\n         \"src_ids\": [\"TARGET_FILE_ID\"],\n         \"ref_ids\": [\"REFERENCE_FILE_ID\"]\n       },\n       \"actions\": [\n         {\n           \"id\": 0,\n           \"params\": {\n             \"face_mapping\": [\n               { \"index\": 0, \"position\": 0 },\n               { \"index\": -1, \"position\": -1 }\n             ]\n           }\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n3. The response returns a `task_id`.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 6: Poll task status and retrieve result\nIt’s necessary to implement a timed loop that queries the task status at regular intervals within the allowed polling window.\n1. Poll at:\n\n   ```\n   GET https://yce-api-01.makeupar.com/s2s/v1.0/task/face-swap?task_id=TASK_ID\n   ```\n2. When `status` is `success`, the response contains a URL for the generated image.\n3. Download or display the image from that URL.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 7: Integrate into your platform\n\n* On a **web frontend**, you can directly implement this with JavaScript using fetch or Axios.\n* On a **backend** (Node.js, Python, Java, PHP, etc.), you can use the same endpoints with standard HTTP libraries.\n* Always secure the **client credentials** and perform authentication safely. Avoid embedding private keys directly in client-side code in production.\n* Implement retry and error handling since the tasks run asynchronously.\n\n\n### Debugging Guide\n1. **Invalid TaskId Error**\n    </br>**Why:** You’ll receive an InvalidTaskId error if you attempt to check the status of a task that has timed out. Therefore, once an AI task is initiated, you’ll need to poll for its status within the polling_interval until the status changes to either success or error.\n    </br>**Solution:** To avoid the task becoming invalid, it’s necessary to implement a timed loop that queries the task status at regular intervals within the allowed polling window.\n\n1. **Why are some faces not detected in my source image**\n    </br>**Why:** Reason: The face must be clearly visible, not covered or obstructed, and large enough within the image\n    </br>**Solution:** Try taking a photo where the face appears larger and is clearly visible without any covering or obstruction\n\n---\n\n## Inputs & Outputs\n\n### Real-world examples:\nMultiple faces swap sample:\n![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/dt_yce_face_swap_S2_img_04_d4b747a41d.jpg)\n\nSingle face swap sample:\n![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/dt_yce_face_swap_S2_img_05_8e68faff2c.jpg)\n\n### Suggestions for How to Shoot:\n![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/strapi/assets/webp_AI%20Skin%20Analysis_camera_f93315b088.png)\n\n\n## File Specs & Errors\n### Supported Formats & Dimensions\n|AI Feature|Supported Dimensions|Supported File Size|Supported Formats|\n|  ----  | ----  | ----  | ----  |\n|AI Face Swap|Input and output: the long side must be less than or equal to 4096 pixels|< 10MB|jpg/jpeg/png|\n\n\n### Error Codes\n| Error Code | Description |\n| ------------------ | ----------- |\n| exceed_max_filesize | The input file size exceeds the maximum limit |\n| invalid_parameter | The parameter value is invalid |\n| error_download_image | There was an error downloading the source image |\n| error_download_mask | There was an error downloading the mask image |\n| error_decode_image | There was an error decoding the source image |\n| error_decode_mask | There was an error decoding the mask image |\n| error_download_video | There was an error downloading the source video |\n| error_decode_video | There was an error decoding the source video |\n| error_nsfw_content_detected | NSFW content was detected in the source image |\n| error_no_face | No face was detected in the source image |\n| error_pose | Failed to detect pose in the source image |\n| error_face_parsing | Failed to perform face parsing on the source image |\n| error_inference | An error occurred in the inference pipeline |\n| exceed_nsfw_retry_limits | Retry limits exceeded to avoid generating NSFW image |\n| error_upload | There was an error uploading the result image |\n| error_multiple_people | People count exceeds the maximum limit |\n| error_no_shoulder | Shoulders are not visible in the source image |\n| error_large_face_angle | The face angle in the uploaded image is too large |\n| error_unsupport_ratio | The aspect ratio of the input image is unsupported |\n| unknown_internal_error | Other internal errors |\n"

      "description": "### AI Skin Analysis V1 API\n![](https://d3ss46vukfdtpo.cloudfront.net/static/media/img_demostore_skincarelive_topbanner.0cffe3a7.jpg)\nAI skincare analysis technology harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to analyze various aspects of the skin, from texture and pigmentation to hydration and pore size, with remarkable precision. By employing advanced algorithms and machine learning, AI skin analysis can offer personalized recommendations and skincare routines tailored to an individual's unique skin type and concerns.\n\nThis not only enhances the effectiveness of skincare products but also empowers users to make informed decisions about their skincare regimen. With the integration of AI skin analysis, individuals can now embark on a journey towards healthier, more radiant skin, guided by data-driven insights and the promise of more effective skincare solutions.\n\n\n## Integration Guide\n### How to Take Photos for AI Skin Analysis\n* Take a selfie facing forward\n  - Just one clear shot, looking straight into the camera. Leave your hair down so it falls over your chest, and make sure you're staring directly ahead for that front-on view.\n  - Instead, use the JS Camera Kit to take a photo. Just leave your hair down so it falls over your chest. Don't tie it up.\n\n### How to Detect Skin Concerns by AI\n1. **Resize your source image**</br>\n  Resize your photo to fit the supported dimensions - up to 1920 pixels on the long side and at least 480 pixels on the short side for SD, or up to 2560 pixels on the long side and at least 1080 pixels on the short side for HD. See details in **[File Specs & Errors](#tag/AI-Skin-Analysis-V1/File-Specs-and-Errors)**\n\n2. **Upload file using the File API**</br>\n  Using the ***v1.1/file/skin-analysis*** API to upload a target user image.\n    - Image Requirements\n      - See details in **[File Specs & Errors](#tag/AI-Skin-Analysis-V1/File-Specs-and-Errors)**.\n    - ***Important***: Simply calling the File API does not upload your file. You must **manually upload** the file to the **URL provided in the File API response**. That URL is your upload destination, make sure the file is successfully transferred there before proceeding.<br>\n    Before calling the AI API, ensure your file has been successfully uploaded. Use the File API to retrieve an upload URL, then upload your file to that location. Once the upload is complete, you'll receive a ***file_id*** in the response, this ID is what you'll use to access AI features related to that file.\n\n      > **Warning:** Please note that, you will get an 500 Server Error / unknown_internal_error or 404 Not Found error when using AI APIs if you do not upload the file to the URL provided in the File API response.\n\n3. **Run an AI Skin Analysis task**</br>\n  Once the upload is complete, you can select 4, 7, or 14 skin concerns to analyze using your file ID. Please refer to the **[Inputs & Outputs](#tag/AI-Skin-Analysis-V1/Inputs-and-Outputs)**.</br>\n  Subsequently, calling POST 'task/skin-analysis' with the\n  File ID executes the enhance task and obtains a ***task_id***.\n\n4. **Polling to check the status of a task until it succeed or error**</BR>\nThis ***task_id*** is used to monitor the task's status through polling GET 'task/skin-analysis' to retrieve the current engine status. Until the engine completes the task, the status will remain 'running', and no units will be consumed during this stage.\n\n    **Warning:** Please note that, **Polling** to check the status of a task based on it's ***polling_interval*** is mandotary. A task will be timed out if there is no polling request within the ***polling_interval***, even if the task is processed succefully(Your unit(s) will be consumed).\n\n    > **Warning:** You will get a ***InvalidTaskId*** error once you check the status of a timed out task. So, once you run an AI task, you need to **polling** to check the status within the ***polling_interval*** until the status become either *success* or *error*.\n\n5. **Get the result of an AI task once success**</BR>\nThe task will change to the 'success' status after the engine successfully processes your input file and generates the resulting image. You will get an url of the processed image and a dst_id that allow you to chain another AI task without re-upload the result image.\nYour units will only be consumed in this case. If the engine fails to process the task, the task's status will change to 'error' and no unit will be consumed.</BR>\nWhen deducting units, the system will prioritize those nearing expiration. If the expiration date is the same, it will deduct the units obtained on the earliest date.\n\n\n### Debugging Guide\n> **Warning:** Please be advised that the system requires processing **exactly 4, 7, or 14** distinct skin concerns at one time. Simultaneous use of SD and HD skin concern parameters is **NOT** supported.

It includes:\n\n* Camera permission handling\n* Real-time face detection\n* Automatic face quality validation (lighting, pose, angle, distance)\n* Guided capture UI\n* Multi-step capture flows for advanced hair/face tasks\n* Support for both **base64** and **blob** output formats\n\nThe module is particularly optimized for **AI-driven image analysis**, such as AI Skin Analysis (SD/HD), AI Face Tone Analysis, and hair-related analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Download the JS Camera Kit\nInclude the JS Camera Kit SDK via CDN:\n\n```\nhttps://plugins-media.makeupar.com/v2.1-camera-kit/sdk.js\n```\n\nOnce loaded, the SDK installs a global `YMK` object.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Start Example\n\nThe following sample

detection UI.\n\n---\n\n**`faceDetectionCaptured`**\nThis event is fired **after all required face quality validation checks have passed** and the Camera Kit has successfully completed the capture workflow.\nDepending on the selected `faceDetectionMode`, the event may contain **one or multiple captured images** (e.g., multi-angle capture for hair modes).\n\n**Callback Arguments**\n**`capturedResult`** — *Object*\nThe result object containing all successfully captured images and metadata.\n\n**Field Definitions**\n**`mode`** — *string*\nIndicates the **active faceDetectionMode** used for capturing.\nPossible values include:\n`\"skincare\" | \"hdskincare\" | \"shadefinder\" | \"hairlength\" | \"hairfrizziness\" | \"hairtype\"`\nThis value corresponds directly to the configuration set in `YMK.init({ faceDetectionMode })`.\n\n**`images`** — *Array<ImageObject>*\nA list of one or more captured images.\nEach entry represents a **single capture phase**, especially relevant for multi-phase modes (e.g., hair analysis).\n\n**ImageObject Structure**\n| Field    | Type           | Description|\n| -------- | -------------- | ---------- |\n| `phase`  | integer        | The zero-based index representing the capture step. <br> Examples: <br> • Skincare = `0` <br> • Hair frizziness sequence = `0` (front), `1` (right turn), `2` (left turn)

      "description": "### AI Skin Analysis\n![](https://d3ss46vukfdtpo.cloudfront.net/static/media/img_demostore_skincarelive_topbanner.0cffe3a7.jpg)\nAI skincare analysis technology harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to analyze various aspects of the skin, from texture and pigmentation to hydration and pore size, with remarkable precision. By employing advanced algorithms and machine learning, AI skin analysis can offer personalized recommendations and skincare routines tailored to an individual's unique skin type and concerns.\n\nThis not only enhances the effectiveness of skincare products but also empowers users to make informed decisions about their skincare regimen. With the integration of AI skin analysis, individuals can now embark on a journey towards healthier, more radiant skin, guided by data-driven insights and the promise of more effective skincare solutions.\n\n\n## Integration Guide\n### How to Take Photos for AI Skin Analysis\n* Take a selfie facing forward\n  - Just one clear shot, looking straight into the camera. Leave your hair down so it falls over your chest, and make sure you're staring directly ahead for that front-on view.\n  - Instead, use the JS Camera Kit to take a photo. Just leave your hair down so it falls over your chest. Don't tie it up.\n\n### Workflow\n1. **Resize your source image**</br>\n  Resize your photo to fit the supported dimensions - up to 1920 pixels on the long side and at least 480 pixels on the short side for SD, or up to 2560 pixels on the long side and at least 1080 pixels on the short side for HD. See details in **[File Specs & Errors](#tag/AI-Skin-Analysis/File-Specs-and-Errors)**\n\n2. **Image Upload Options**</br>\n  - Image Requirements\n    - See details in **[File Specs & Errors](#tag/AI-Skin-Analysis/File-Specs-and-Errors)**.\n  You can provide the source image in one of two ways:\n\n  - **Upload via File API**\n    Use the endpoint:\n    ```\n    POST /v2.0/file/skin-analysis\n    ```\n    This returns a `file_id` for subsequent task execution.\n\n    - ***Important***: Simply calling the File API does not upload your file. You must **manually upload** the file to the **URL provided in the File API response**. That URL is your upload destination, make sure the file is successfully transferred there before proceeding.<br></br>\n    Before calling the AI API, ensure your file has been successfully uploaded. Use the File API to retrieve an upload URL, then upload your file to that location. Once the upload is complete, you'll receive a ***file_id*** in the response, this ID is what you'll use to access AI features related to that file.\n\n      > **Warning:** Please note that, you will get an 500 Server Error / unknown_internal_error or 404 Not Found error when using AI APIs if you do not upload the file to the URL provided in the File API response.\n\n  - **Use an Existing Public Image URL**\n    Instead of uploading, you may supply a publicly accessible image URL directly when initiating the AI task.\n\n3. **Run an AI Skin Analysis task**</br>\n  Once the upload is complete, you can select 4, 7, or 14 skin concerns to analyze using your file ID or image file url. Please refer to the **[Inputs & Outputs](#tag/AI-Skin-Analysis/Inputs-and-Outputs)**.</br>\n  Subsequently, calling POST 'task/skin-analysis' with the\n  File ID or image file url executes the enhance task and obtains a ***task_id***.\n\n4. **Get the result of an AI task once success**</BR>\n  This ***task_id*** is used to monitor the task's status through polling GET 'task/skin-analysis' to retrieve the current engine status. Until the engine completes the task, the status will remain 'running', and no units will be consumed during this stage.</br></br>\n  Processed results are retained for 24 hours after completion.- No need for short-interval polling.- Flexible polling intervals within the 24-hour window.- Important: Polling is still required to check task status, as execution time is not guaranteed.</br></br>\n  The task will change to the 'success' status after the engine successfully processes your input file and generates the resulting image. You will get an url of the processed image and a dst_id that allow you to chain another AI task without re-upload the result image.\n  Your units will only be consumed in this case. If the engine fails to process the task, the task's status will change to 'error' and no unit will be consumed.</BR>\n  When deducting units, the system will prioritize those nearing expiration. If the expiration date is the same, it will deduct the units obtained on the earliest date.\n\n### Debugging Guide\n> **Warning:** Please be advised that the system requires processing **exactly 4, 7, or 14** distinct skin concerns at one time. Simultaneous use of SD and HD skin concern parameters is **NOT** supported. Attempting to deviate from these specifications will result in an ***InvalidParameters*** error.\n\n  * For example, if you run a task with 5 HD skin concerns, you will get an error as following:\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"status\": 400,\n        \"error\": \"must select 4, 7 or 14 distinct dst_actions\",\n        \"error_code\": \"InvalidParameters\"\n    }\n    ```\n  * If you mix using HD and SD skin concerns, you will get an error as following:\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"status\": 400,\n        \"error\": \"cannot mix HD and SD dst_actions\",\n        \"error_code\": \"InvalidParameters\"\n    }\n    ```\n  * If you misspell a skin concern or sending unknown skin concerns, you will get an error as following:\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"status\": 400,\n        \"error\": \"Not available dst_action abc123\",\n        \"error_code\": \"InvalidParameters\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n---\n\n### Real-world examples:\n![](https://plugins-media.makeupar.com/webconsultation/images/skincare-widget/img_webcm_skincare_service_survey_demo.jpg)\n![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/skin_analysis_s5_poster_3_dt_85efe14952.png)\n![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/Skincare_Pro_Medspa_Situation_Image_6aea6046f9.jpg)\n\n## Inputs & Outputs\n### Input Paramenter Description\nThere are two options for controlling the visual output of AI Skin Analysis results: either generate multiple images, with each skin concern displayed as an independent mask, or produce a single blended image using the ``enable_mask_overlay`` parameter. By default, the system outputs multiple masks, giving you full control over how to blend each skin concern mask with the image.\n\n* Default: enable_mask_overlay false\n  ![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/strapi/assets/mask_overlay_false_1920_ea1cde0ead.png)\n\n* Set enable_mask_overlay to true\n  ![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/strapi/assets/mask_overlay_1920_0fbb4786cc.png)\n\n----\n\n### Output ZIP Data Structure Description\nThe system provides a ZIP file with a 'skinanalysisResult' folder inside. This folder contains a 'score_info.json' file that includes all the detection scores and references to the result images.\n\nThe 'score_info.json' file contains all the skin analysis detection results, with numerical scores and the names of the corresponding output mask files.\n\nThe PNG files are detection result masks that can be overlaid on your original image. Simply use the alpha values in these PNG files to blend them with your original image, allowing you to see the detection results directly on the source image.\n\n### File Structure in the Skin Analysis Result ZIP\n* HD Skincare ZIP\n  * skinanalysisResult\n    - score_info.json\n    - hd_acne_output.png\n    - hd_age_spot_output.png\n    - hd_dark_circle_output.png\n    - hd_droopy_lower_eyelid_output.png\n    - hd_droopy_upper_eyelid_output.png\n    - hd_eye_bag_output.png\n    - hd_firmness_output.png\n    - hd_moisture_output.png\n    - hd_oiliness_output.png\n    - hd_radiance_output.png\n    - hd_redness_output.png\n    - hd_texture_output.png\n    - hd_pore_output_all.png\n    - hd_pore_output_cheek.png\n    - hd_pore_output_forehead.png\n    - hd_pore_output_nose.png\n    - hd_wrinkle_output_all.png\n    - hd_wrinkle_output_crowfeet.png\n    - hd_wrinkle_output_forehead.png\n    - hd_wrinkle_output_glabellar.png\n    - hd_wrinkle_output_marionette.png\n    - hd_wrinkle_output_nasolabial.png\n    - hd_wrinkle_output_periocular.png\n\n* SD Skincare ZIP\n  * skinanalysisResult\n    - score_info.json\n    - acne_output.png\n    - age_spot_output.png\n    - dark_circle_v2_output.png\n    - droopy_lower_eyelid_output.png\n    - droopy_upper_eyelid_output.png\n    - eye_bag_output.png\n    - firmness_output.png\n    - moisture_output.png\n    - oiliness_output.png\n    - pore_output.png\n    - radiance_output.png\n    - redness_output.png\n    - texture_output.png\n    - wrinkle_output.png\n\n* JSON Data Structure (score_info.json)\n  * \"all\": A floating-point value between 1 and 100 representing the general skin condition.

It is highly recommended to use **portrait** rather than landscape aspect ratio as input.\n\n### Suggestions for How to Shoot:\n![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/strapi/assets/webp_AI%20Skin%20Analysis_camera_f93315b088.png)\n\n### Get Ready to Start Skin Analysis Instructions\n* Take off your glasses and make sure bangs are not covering your forehead\n* Make sure that you’re in a well-lit environment\n* Remove makeup to get more accurate results\n* Look straight into the camera and keep your face in the center\n\n### Photo requirement\nWe will check the image quality to ensure it is suitable for AI Skin Analysis. Please make sure the face occupies approximately 60–80% of the image width, without any overlays or obstructions. The lighting should be bright and evenly distributed, avoiding overexposure or blown-out highlights. The pose should be front-facing, neutral, and relaxed, with the mouth closed and eyes open.\n\nYou should fully reveal your forehead and brush your fringe back or tie your hair to ensure the best quality. It is recommended that you remove your spectacles for optimal AI Skin Analysis performance, although this is not mandatory.\n> **Warning:** The width of the face needs to be greater than 60% of the width of the image.\n\n![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/strapi/assets/webp_AI%20Skin%20Analysis_error_src_face_too_small_cr_725792a7fb.png)\n\n\n### Error Codes\n|Error Code|Description|\n|  ----  | ----  |\n|error_below_min_image_size|Input image resolution is too small|\n|error_exceed_max_image_size|Input image resolution is too large|\n|error_src_face_too_small|The face area in the uploaded image is too small.

It includes:\n\n* Camera permission handling\n* Real-time face detection\n* Automatic face quality validation (lighting, pose, angle, distance)\n* Guided capture UI\n* Multi-step capture flows for advanced hair/face tasks\n* Support for both **base64** and **blob** output formats\n\nThe module is particularly optimized for **AI-driven image analysis**, such as AI Skin Analysis (SD/HD), AI Face Tone Analysis, and hair-related analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Download the JS Camera Kit\nInclude the JS Camera Kit SDK via CDN:\n\n```\nhttps://plugins-media.makeupar.com/v2.1-camera-kit/sdk.js\n```\n\nOnce loaded, the SDK installs a global `YMK` object.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Start Example\n\nThe following sample demonstrates:\n\n* Loading the JS Camera Kit SDK\n* Implementing `window.ymkAsyncInit`\n* Initializing the module\n* Opening the camera\n* Receiving captured images\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html

id=\"captured-results\"></div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n---\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nYou must define the asynchronous initialization entry point:\n\n```html\n<script>\n  window.ymkAsyncInit = function() {\n    YMK.init(); // default settings\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\nAdditional requirements:\n\n| Requirement             | Description                                 |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |\n| Browser                 | Must support `getUserMedia`                 |\n| HTTPS                   | Required on most browsers for webcam access |\n| `<div id=\"YMK-module\">` | Mandatory mount point for the UI            |\n\n---\n\n### Integration Guide\n\n#### Step 1 — Initialize the Module\n\nCall `YMK.init()` before calling `YMK.openCameraKit()`:\n\n```javascript\nYMK.init({\n  faceDetectionMode: 'skincare',\n  imageFormat: 'base64',\n  language: 'enu'\n});\n```\n\n##### Supported Detection Modes\n\n| Mode             | Description                                               |\n| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `makeup`         | Standard camera mode

detection UI.\n\n---\n\n**`faceDetectionCaptured`**\nThis event is fired **after all required face quality validation checks have passed** and the Camera Kit has successfully completed the capture workflow.\nDepending on the selected `faceDetectionMode`, the event may contain **one or multiple captured images** (e.g., multi-angle capture for hair modes).\n\n**Callback Arguments**\n**`capturedResult`** — *Object*\nThe result object containing all successfully captured images and metadata.\n\n**Field Definitions**\n**`mode`** — *string*\nIndicates the **active faceDetectionMode** used for capturing.\nPossible values include:\n`\"skincare\" | \"hdskincare\" | \"shadefinder\" | \"hairlength\" | \"hairfrizziness\" | \"hairtype\"`\nThis value corresponds directly to the configuration set in `YMK.init({ faceDetectionMode })`.\n\n**`images`** — *Array<ImageObject>*\nA list of one or more captured images.\nEach entry represents a **single capture phase**, especially relevant for multi-phase modes (e.g., hair analysis).\n\n**ImageObject Structure**\n| Field    | Type           | Description|\n| -------- | -------------- | ---------- |\n| `phase`  | integer        | The zero-based index representing the capture step. <br> Examples: <br> • Skincare = `0` <br> • Hair frizziness sequence = `0` (front), `1` (right turn), `2` (left turn) |\n| `image`  | string or Blob | The captured image. <br> • Base64 string if `args.imageFormat = \"base64\"` <br> • Binary Blob if `args.imageFormat = \"blob\"` |\n| `width`  | integer        | Pixel width of the captured image. |\n| `height` | integer        | Pixel height of the captured image. |\n\n---\n**Notes**\n* The **number of images** varies depending on `faceDetectionMode`.\n  * Example: `\"hairfrizziness\"` and `\"hairtype\"` typically produce **three** images.\n* Image **resolution may differ** from device to device.\n  The actual pixel size depends on:\n  * The user's webcam maximum resolution\n  * The constraints and recommended settings for the selected mode\n* All images are guaranteed to meet the **minimum face quality requirements** before this event is dispatched.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration Notes\n\n**Quality Requirements**\n\n* Ensure correct distance\n* Ensure frontal face angle\n* Provide sufficient lighting (avoid shadows)\n\n**Multi-Phase Capture**\nModes like `hairtype` or `hairfrizziness` require:\n1. Front face\n2. Turn right\n3. Turn left\n\nEnsure event handling is in place.\n"

Using AI and photo editing technology, these apps overlay outfits onto your image so you can see how different styles and fits look on your body type. It’s perfect for online shopping, style inspiration, or just playing around with fashion ideas. Try on clothes virtually with AI Clothes . Upload any clothing reference to swap outfits with you photo for an instant virtual wardrobe transformation.\n\n---\n\n## Integration Guide\n\n### API Playground\nYou can use the API Playground to test the AI Clothes virtual try-on feature. This allows you to experiment with your ideas and gain a better understanding of the try-on process.\n\nAccess the API Playground at:\n<https://yce.makeupar.com/api-console/en/api-playground/ai-clothes/>\n\n---\n\n### AI Clothes Virtual Try-On Flow\n\n1.  **Upload a File Using the File API**\n    Use the v2.0/file/cloth API to upload a target user image.\n    Image Requirements:\n    *   Refer to the section File Specs and Errors for detailed specifications.\n    *   Upload a full-body photo of yourself. The virtual outfit changer works best with high-resolution photos that clearly show your clothing. The background should not contain multiple people or distracting objects.\n\n2.  **Choose Predefined Outfit Styles or Upload a Reference Outfit Image**\n    There are two options for providing an outfit for the AI Clothes virtual try-on:\n    *   Use v2.0/task/template/cloth to fetch a predefined outfit template list and select a ``template_id`` to run an AI task.\n    *   Upload a reference outfit image. Image Requirements:\n        *   Refer to the section File Specs and Errors for detailed specifications.\n        *   Use the v2.0/file/cloth API to upload an image or provide a valid image URL. Supported options include:\n            *   A product image of the clothing\n            *   A full-body photo as an outfit reference\n\n3.  **Run an AI Task to Obtain a Task ID**\n    Execute the AI task using v2.0/task/cloth. For the target user image, provide either ``src_file_url`` or ``src_file_id``. For the reference outfit image, provide either ``ref_file_url``, ``ref_file_id``, or ``template_id``.\n    To ensure optimal results, follow these requirements:\n\n    *   Match the clothing type to the selected body area:\n        *   For Upper Body, the garment must be a top.\n        *   For Lower Body, the garment must be trousers or a skirt.\n        *   For dresses or full-body outfits, select Full Body rather than upper or lower body individually.\n\n    > **Warning:** If there is a mismatch between the selected try-on region and the uploaded clothing image, the system will default to the region defined by the clothing image. For example, if you select Full Body but upload an upper-body garment, only the upper body will be applied.\n\n    > **Warning:** Ensure that your source image includes the necessary body part for the virtual clothing to be applied; otherwise, an ``error_apply_region_mismatch`` error will occur.\n\n    > **Warning:** If the chosen clothing style does not match the body area selected for application, the system prioritises the clothing image to determine where it will be applied. For example, if a user selects Full Body but uploads an image of only the upper body, the clothing will be applied only to the upper body.\n\n4.  **Poll to Check the Status of a Task Until It Succeeds or Fails**\n    Use the ``task_id`` to monitor the task status by polling GET v2.0/task/cloth to retrieve the current engine status. Until the engine completes the task, the status will remain as running, and no units will be consumed during this stage.\n    You can also implement a webhook to receive notifications when an AI task succeeds or fails. Refer to the **[Webhook](#tag/Webhook)** section for details.\n\n    > **Warning:** Polling to check the status of a task within its retention period is mandatory. A task will time out if there is no polling request within the retention period, even if the task is processed successfully. Your units will still be consumed.\n\n    > **Warning:** You will receive an InvalidTaskId error if you check the status of a timed-out task. Therefore, once you run an AI task, you must poll to check the status within the retention period until the status becomes either success or error.\n\n5.  **Retrieve the Result of an AI Task Once Successful**\n    The task status will change to success after the engine processes your input file and generates the resulting image.

The photo background should not have too many people or distracting objects.\n* There are two ways to list outfits for AI Fabric virtual try-on:\n  - v1.0: First, call the style-group to retrieve groups, then call the style to access styles within the group you're interested in.\n  - v1.1: Call the predefined style list by category without passing a category_id. Categories will include either styles or subcategories — if there’s only one layer, categories will only contain styles. If there are multiple layers, they’ll have subcategories. If you want to explore a subcategory, pass its ID in category_id and call again.\n\n\n\n> **Warning:** You need to ensure that your source image includes the necessary body part for the virtual clothing to be applied; otherwise, an ***error_apply_region_not_detected*** error will be triggered.\n\nUse cases:\n![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/strapi/assets/AI%20Fabric.png)\n\n![](https://plugins-media.makeupar.com/smb/blog/post/2024-05-07/b103976d-1b0e-4bed-aab4-9307308b84d7.jpg)\n\n![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/strapi/assets/03%20ai%20clothes%20changer.jpg)\n\nSuggestions for How to Shoot:\n![Suggestions for How to Shoot](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/strapi/assets/AI-Cloth-Guideline.png \"Suggestions for How to Shoot\")\n\n### Supported Formats & Dimensions\n|AI Feature|Supported Dimensions|Supported File Size|Supported Formats|\n|  ----  | ----  | ----  | ----  |\n|AI Fabric|long side <= 4096, single person only, The abdomen, face, and shoulders should all be visible.

      "description": "### AI Face Analyzer\nThe AI Face Analyzer examines face structure, identifying features like face, eye, eyebrow, lip, nose, cheekbone shapes, designed to provide personalized recommendations.\n\n## Integration Guide\n### How to Take Photos for AI Face Analysis\n* Take a selfie facing forward\n  - Just one clear photo, looking straight into the camera. It is best to let your hair fall naturally, with your entire face visible and nothing covering it. Brush your hair back to reveal your forehead, and make sure you are looking directly ahead to capture a proper front view.\n  - Instead, use the JS Camera Kit to take the photo. Follow the automatic face alignment, lighting guidance, and face size detection to ensure the photo meets the required standards for processing.\n\n### How to Detect Skin Concerns by AI\n1. **Resize your source image**</br>\n  Resize your photo to fit the supported dimensions. See details in **[File Specs & Errors](#tag/AI-Face-Analyzer/File-Specs-and-Errors)**\n\n2. **Upload file using the File API**</br>\n  Using the ***v2.0/file/face-attr-analysis*** API to upload a target user image.\n    - Image Requirements\n      - See details in **[File Specs & Errors](#tag/AI-Face-Analyzer/File-Specs-and-Errors)**.\n    - ***Important***: Simply calling the File API does not upload your file. You must **manually upload** the file to the **URL provided in the File API response**. That URL is your upload destination, make sure the file is successfully transferred there before proceeding.<br>\n    Before calling the AI API, ensure your file has been successfully uploaded. Use the File API to retrieve an upload URL, then upload your file to that location. Once the upload is complete, you'll receive a ***file_id*** in the response, this ID is what you'll use to access AI features related to that file.\n\n      > **Warning:** Please note that, you will get an 500 Server Error / unknown_internal_error or 404 Not Found error when using AI APIs if you do not upload the file to the URL provided in the File API response.\n\n3. **Run an AI Face Analysis task**</br>\n  Once the upload is complete, you can select multiple face attributes to analyze using your file ID. Please refer to the **[Inputs & Outputs](#tag/AI-Face-Analyzer/Inputs-and-Outputs)**.</br>\n  Subsequently, calling POST 'task/face-attr-analysis' with the\n  File ID executes the enhance task and obtains a ***task_id***.\n\n4. **Polling to check the status of a task until it succeed or error**</BR>\nThis ***task_id*** is used to monitor the task's status through polling GET 'task/face-attr-analysis' to retrieve the current engine status. Until the engine completes the task, the status will remain 'running', and no units will be consumed during this stage.\n\n    **Warning:** Please note that, **Polling** to check the status of a task based on it's retention period is mandotary. A task will be timed out if there is no polling request within the retention period, even if the task is processed succefully(Your unit(s) will be consumed).\n\n    > **Warning:** You will get a ***InvalidTaskId*** error once you check the status of a timed out task. So, once you run an AI task, you need to **polling** to check the status within the retention period until the status become either *success* or *error*.\n\n5. **Get the result of an AI task once success**</BR>\nThe task will change to the 'success' status after the engine successfully processes your input file and generates the resulting image. You will get an url of the processed image and a dst_id that allow you to chain another AI task without re-upload the result image.\nYour units will only be consumed in this case. If the engine fails to process the task, the task's status will change to 'error' and no unit will be consumed.</BR>\nWhen deducting units, the system will prioritize those nearing expiration. If the expiration date is the same, it will deduct the units obtained on the earliest date.\n\n### Real-world examples:\n![](https://plugins-media.makeupar.com/smb/blog/post/2025-01-15/10a4b980-f571-4d08-8f5d-e3ed48db77aa.jpg)\n\n## Inputs & Outputs\n### Face Attributes:\n![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/img_Face_Ratio_sec_01_01_enu_79380baa14.jpg)\n\n| **Category**     | **Subcategory**   | **Request Parameter** | **Result Parameter** | **Result Types** |\n| --- | --- | --- |  --- | --- |\n| **FACE** | Face Shape | `faceShape` | `faceshape` | Triangle, Diamond, Heart, InvTriangle, Oblong, Oval, Round, Square, Unknown |\n| **AGE & GENDER** | Age | `age` | `agegender.age` | integer |\n| | Gender | `gender` | `agegender.gender` | female, male, unknown |\n| **EYES** | Eye Shape | `eyeShape` | `eyelid.left_shape`, `eyelid.right_shape` | Narrow, Round, Almond |\n| | Eye Size | `eyeSize` | `eyelid.size` | Big, Small, Average |\n| | Eye Angle | `eyeAngle` | `eyelid.left_angle`, `eyelid.right_angle` | Downturned, Upturned, Average |\n| | Eye Distance | `eyeDistance` | `eyelid.setting` | Close-set, Wide-Set, Average |\n| | Eyelid | `eyelid` | `eyelid.left_eyelid`, `eyelid.right_eyelid` | Hooded-lid, Single-lid, Double-lid, Deep-Set |\n| **BROWS** | Eyebrow Shape | `eyebrowShape` | `eyebrow.left_shape`, `eyebrow.right_shape` | Hard Angled, Soft Angled, Straight, Rounded, Obscured |\n| | Eyebrow Thickness | `eyebrowThickness` | `eyebrow.left_body_thickness`, `eyebrow.right_body_thickness` | Dense, Sparse, Average, Unknown |\n| | Eyebrow Distance | `eyebrowDistance` | `eyebrow.gap` | Far-Apart, Close, Average |\n| | Eyebrow Shortness | `eyebrowShortness` | `eyebrow.left_shortness`, `eyebrow.right_shortness` | Short, Normal |\n| **LIPS** | Lip Shape | `lipShape` | `lipshape[]` | Bow, Downturned, Full, Heavy Lower Lip, Heavy Upper Lip, Narrow, Round, Thin, Wide, Average |\n| **NOSE** | Nose Width | `noseWidth` | `nose.width` | Narrow, Broad, Average |\n| | Nose Length | `noseLength` | `nose.length` | Long, Short, Average |\n| **CHEEKBONES**   | Cheekbones | `cheekbones` | `cheekbone.left`, `cheekbone.right`, `cheekbone.overrall` | Flat Cheekbone, High Cheekbone, Low Cheekbone, Round Cheeks |\n| **COLORS** | Eye Color | `eyeColor` | `color.eye_color`, `color.eye_color_name` | Hex value <br>Amber, Brown, Green, Blue, Gray, Other |\n| | Lip Color | `lipColor` | `color.lip_color` | Hex value |\n| | Eyebrow Color | `eyebrowColor` | `color.eyebrow_color` | Hex value |\n| | Hair Color | `hairColor` | `color.hair_color`, `color.hair_color_name` | Hex value <br>Auburn, Black, Blonde, Brown, Grey/White, Red |\n\n---\n\n### Face Ratios:\n![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/img_Face_Ratio_sec_01_03_2fe8f06b92.jpg)\n\n| **Subcategory** | **Request Parameter** | **Result Parameter** | **Result Types** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Horizontal Third Ratio | `horizontalThird` | `horizontal_third` | Three-section percentages; Interpretation: Short / Balanced / Long; Golden Ratio: 33% : 33% : 33% | The Face Horizontal Ratio is based on dividing the face into three equal sections: from the hairline to the bottom of the eyebrows, from the bottom of eyebrows to the bottom of the nose, and from the bottom of the nose to the tip of the chin. The golden ratio, or ideal proportion, between the three is 1:1:1.|\n| Vertical Fifth Ratio | `verticalFifth` | `vertical_fifth` | Five-section percentages; Interpretation (Eye Distance & Eye Width): Narrow / Balanced / Wide; Golden Ratio: 20% : 20% : 20% : 20% : 20% | The Face Vertical Ratio is determined by dividing the face into five sections: the width of one eye, the distance between the eyes, and the space between the outer corners of the eyes to the edges of the face. The golden ration for these proportions is 1:1:1:1:1. |\n| Face Aspect Ratio | `faceAspectRatio` | `face_aspect_ratio` | `[1, r]`; Interpretation: Short / Balanced / Long; Golden Ratio: 1 : 1.46 | The Face Aspect Ratio is the relationship between the width of the face and its height, ideally following the golden ratio of 1:1.46, thus creating a balanced and aesthetically pleasing appearance. |\n| Eye Aspect Ratio | `eyeAspectRatio` | `left_eye_aspect_ratio` `right_eye_aspect_ratio` | `[1, r]`; Interpretation: Round / Balanced / Flat; Golden Ratio: 1 : 3 | The Eye Aspect Ratio is the relationship between the height of the eye compared to its width, ideally aligning with the golden ratio of 1:3, ensuring the most aesthetically balanced look.\n |\n| Eyebrow Arch Ratio | `eyebrowArch` | `left_eyebrow_arch_to_eyebrow_width` `right_eyebrow_arch_to_eyebrow_width` | `[1, r]`; Interpretation: Short Arch / Balanced / Long Arch; Golden Ratio: 1 : 1.618 | The ideal proportion of the Eyebrow Arch is determined by the shape of the eyebrow itself, where the highest point (the arch) aligns with the golden ratio for an aesthetically pleasing look. |\n| Eye Height to Eyebrow Distance | `eyeHeightToEyebrowDistance` | `left_eye_height_to_eyebrow_distance` `right_eye_height_to_eyebrow_distance` `overall_eye_height_to_eyebrow_distance` | `[1, r]`; Interpretation: Short / Balanced / Long; Golden Ratio: 1 : 1.618 | The Eye to Eyebrow Distance is the vertical distance from the top of the upper eyelid to the highest point of the eyebrow. Ideally, it would follow the golden ratio of 1.618:1 when compared to the eye height, for the most harmonious balance between the eyes and the brows. |\n| Nose Aspect Ratio | `noseAspectRatio` | `nose_aspect_ratio` | `[1, r]`; Interpretation: Wide / Balanced / Narrow; Golden Ratio: 1 : 1.618 | The Nose Aspect Ratio is the relationship between the width of the nose and its height, ideally following the golden ratio of 1:1.618. |\n| Nose Width to Mouth Width | `noseWidthToMouthWidth` | `nose_width_to_mouth_width` | `[1, r]`; Interpretation: Small / Balanced / Large; Golden Ratio: 1 : 1.618 | The Nose Width to Mouth Width ratio is the relationship between the width of the nose and that of the mouth, ideally following the golden ratio of 1:1.618, creating a balanced and aesthetically pleasing appearance. |\n| Nose to Lip to Chin | `noseToLipToChin` | `nose_to_lip_to_chin` | `[1, r]`; Interpretation: Short / Balanced / Long (lower face length); Golden Ratio: 1 : 1.618 | The Nose to Lip to Chin ratio is a proportion where the distance from the base of the nose to the center of the lip is 1, and the ideal distance from the center of the lip to the chin is 1.618. This golden ratio creates a balanced and harmonious lower face, following the principles of facial symmetry. |\n| Upper Lip to Lower Lip | `upperLipToLowerLip` | `upper_lip_to_lower_lip` | `[1, r]`; Interpretation: Full Upper / Balanced / Full Lower; Golden Ratio: 1 : 1.618 | The golden ratio of the Upper Lip to the Lower Lip suggests that the thickness of the lower lip should be 1.618 times that of the upper lip. This proportion creates a balanced and aesthetically pleasing look, with the lower lip being slightly fuller than the upper lip. |\n\n----\n\n### Suggestions for How to Shoot:\n![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/strapi/assets/AI_Face_Analysis_how_to_shoot_35ca9af08e.png)\n\n> **Warning:** The width of the face needs to be greater than 60% of the width of the image.\n\n## File Specs & Errors\n### Supported Formats & Dimensions\n|AI Feature|Supported Dimensions|Supported File Size|Supported Formats|\n|  ----  | ----  | ----  | ----  |\n|AI Face Analyzer|long side <= 4096, single person only.

detection UI.\n\n---\n\n**`faceDetectionCaptured`**\nThis event is fired **after all required face quality validation checks have passed** and the Camera Kit has successfully completed the capture workflow.\nDepending on the selected `faceDetectionMode`, the event may contain **one or multiple captured images** (e.g., multi-angle capture for hair modes).\n\n**Callback Arguments**\n**`capturedResult`** — *Object*\nThe result object containing all successfully captured images and metadata.\n\n**Field Definitions**\n**`mode`** — *string*\nIndicates the **active faceDetectionMode** used for capturing.\nPossible values include:\n`\"skincare\" | \"hdskincare\" | \"shadefinder\" | \"hairlength\" | \"hairfrizziness\" | \"hairtype\"`\nThis value corresponds directly to the configuration set in `YMK.init({ faceDetectionMode })`.\n\n**`images`** — *Array<ImageObject>*\nA list of one or more captured images.\nEach entry represents a **single capture phase**, especially relevant for multi-phase modes (e.g., hair analysis).\n\n**ImageObject Structure**\n| Field    | Type           | Description|\n| -------- | -------------- | ---------- |\n| `phase`  | integer        | The zero-based index representing the capture step. <br> Examples: <br> • Skincare = `0` <br> • Hair frizziness sequence = `0` (front), `1` (right turn), `2` (left turn) |\n| `image`  | string or Blob | The captured image. <br> • Base64 string if `args.imageFormat = \"base64\"` <br> • Binary Blob if `args.imageFormat = \"blob\"` |\n| `width`  | integer        | Pixel width of the captured image. |\n| `height` | integer        | Pixel height of the captured image. |\n\n---\n**Notes**\n* The **number of images** varies depending on `faceDetectionMode`.\n  * Example: `\"hairfrizziness\"` and `\"hairtype\"` typically produce **three** images.\n* Image **resolution may differ** from device to device.\n  The actual pixel size depends on:\n  * The user's webcam maximum resolution\n  * The constraints and recommended settings for the selected mode\n* All images are guaranteed to meet the **minimum face quality requirements** before this event is dispatched.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration Notes\n\n**Quality Requirements**\n\n* Ensure correct distance\n* Ensure frontal face angle\n* Provide sufficient lighting (avoid shadows)\n\n**Multi-Phase Capture**\nModes like `hairtype` or `hairfrizziness` require:\n1. Front face\n2. Turn right\n3. Turn left\n\nEnsure event handling is in place.\n"

      "description": "### AI Face Analyzer\nThe AI Face Analyzer examines face structure, identifying features like face, eye, eyebrow, lip, nose, cheekbone shapes, designed to provide personalized recommendations.\n\n## Integration Guide\n### How to Take Photos for AI Face Analysis\n* Take a selfie facing forward\n  - Just one clear photo, looking straight into the camera. It is best to let your hair fall naturally, with your entire face visible and nothing covering it. Brush your hair back to reveal your forehead, and make sure you are looking directly ahead to capture a proper front view.\n  - Instead, use the JS Camera Kit to take the photo. Follow the automatic face alignment, lighting guidance, and face size detection to ensure the photo meets the required standards for processing.\n\n### How to Detect Skin Concerns by AI\n1. **Resize your source image**</br>\n  Resize your photo to fit the supported dimensions. See details in **[File Specs & Errors](#tag/AI-Face-Analyzer/File-Specs-and-Errors)**\n\n2. **Upload file using the File API**</br>\n  Using the ***v2.0/file/face-attr-analysis*** API to upload a target user image.\n    - Image Requirements\n      - See details in **[File Specs & Errors](#tag/AI-Face-Analyzer/File-Specs-and-Errors)**.\n    - ***Important***: Simply calling the File API does not upload your file. You must **manually upload** the file to the **URL provided in the File API response**. That URL is your upload destination, make sure the file is successfully transferred there before proceeding.<br>\n    Before calling the AI API, ensure your file has been successfully uploaded. Use the File API to retrieve an upload URL, then upload your file to that location. Once the upload is complete, you'll receive a ***file_id*** in the response, this ID is what you'll use to access AI features related to that file.\n\n      > **Warning:** Please note that, you will get an 500 Server Error / unknown_internal_error or 404 Not Found error when using AI APIs if you do not upload the file to the URL provided in the File API response.\n\n3. **Run an AI Face Analysis task**</br>\n  Once the upload is complete, you can select multiple face attributes to analyze using your file ID. Please refer to the **[Inputs & Outputs](#tag/AI-Face-Analyzer/Inputs-and-Outputs)**.</br>\n  Subsequently, calling POST 'task/face-attr-analysis' with the\n  File ID executes the enhance task and obtains a ***task_id***.\n\n4. **Polling to check the status of a task until it succeed or error**</BR>\nThis ***task_id*** is used to monitor the task's status through polling GET 'task/face-attr-analysis' to retrieve the current engine status. Until the engine completes the task, the status will remain 'running', and no units will be consumed during this stage.\n\n    **Warning:** Please note that, **Polling** to check the status of a task based on it's retention period is mandotary. A task will be timed out if there is no polling request within the retention period, even if the task is processed succefully(Your unit(s) will be consumed).\n\n    > **Warning:** You will get a ***InvalidTaskId*** error once you check the status of a timed out task. So, once you run an AI task, you need to **polling** to check the status within the retention period until the status become either *success* or *error*.\n\n5. **Get the result of an AI task once success**</BR>\nThe task will change to the 'success' status after the engine successfully processes your input file and generates the resulting image. You will get an url of the processed image and a dst_id that allow you to chain another AI task without re-upload the result image.\nYour units will only be consumed in this case. If the engine fails to process the task, the task's status will change to 'error' and no unit will be consumed.</BR>\nWhen deducting units, the system will prioritize those nearing expiration. If the expiration date is the same, it will deduct the units obtained on the earliest date.\n\n### Real-world examples:\n![](https://plugins-media.makeupar.com/smb/blog/post/2025-01-15/10a4b980-f571-4d08-8f5d-e3ed48db77aa.jpg)\n\n## Inputs & Outputs\n### Face Attributes:\n![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/img_Face_Ratio_sec_01_01_enu_79380baa14.jpg)\n\n| **Category**     | **Subcategory**   | **Request Parameter** | **Result Parameter** | **Result Types** |\n| --- | --- | --- |  --- | --- |\n| **FACE** | Face Shape | `faceShape` | `faceshape` | Triangle, Diamond, Heart, InvTriangle, Oblong, Oval, Round, Square, Unknown |\n| **AGE & GENDER** | Age | `age` | `agegender.age` | integer |\n| | Gender | `gender` | `agegender.gender` | female, male, unknown |\n| **EYES** | Eye Shape | `eyeShape` | `eyelid.left_shape`, `eyelid.right_shape` | Narrow, Round, Almond |\n| | Eye Size | `eyeSize` | `eyelid.size` | Big, Small, Average |\n| | Eye Angle | `eyeAngle` | `eyelid.left_angle`, `eyelid.right_angle` | Downturned, Upturned, Average |\n| | Eye Distance | `eyeDistance` | `eyelid.setting` | Close-set, Wide-Set, Average |\n| | Eyelid | `eyelid` | `eyelid.left_eyelid`, `eyelid.right_eyelid` | Hooded-lid, Single-lid, Double-lid, Deep-Set |\n| **BROWS** | Eyebrow Shape | `eyebrowShape` | `eyebrow.left_shape`, `eyebrow.right_shape` | Hard Angled, Soft Angled, Straight, Rounded, Obscured |\n| | Eyebrow Thickness | `eyebrowThickness` | `eyebrow.left_body_thickness`, `eyebrow.right_body_thickness` | Dense, Sparse, Average, Unknown |\n| | Eyebrow Distance | `eyebrowDistance` | `eyebrow.gap` | Far-Apart, Close, Average |\n| | Eyebrow Shortness | `eyebrowShortness` | `eyebrow.left_shortness`, `eyebrow.right_shortness` | Short, Normal |\n| **LIPS** | Lip Shape | `lipShape` | `lipshape[]` | Bow, Downturned, Full, Heavy Lower Lip, Heavy Upper Lip, Narrow, Round, Thin, Wide, Average |\n| **NOSE** | Nose Width | `noseWidth` | `nose.width` | Narrow, Broad, Average |\n| | Nose Length | `noseLength` | `nose.length` | Long, Short, Average |\n| **CHEEKBONES**   | Cheekbones | `cheekbones` | `cheekbone.left`, `cheekbone.right`, `cheekbone.overrall` | Flat Cheekbone, High Cheekbone, Low Cheekbone, Round Cheeks |\n| **COLORS** | Eye Color | `eyeColor` | `color.eye_color`, `color.eye_color_name` | Hex value <br>Amber, Brown, Green, Blue, Gray, Other |\n| | Lip Color | `lipColor` | `color.lip_color` | Hex value |\n| | Eyebrow Color | `eyebrowColor` | `color.eyebrow_color` | Hex value |\n| | Hair Color | `hairColor` | `color.hair_color`, `color.hair_color_name` | Hex value <br>Auburn, Black, Blonde, Brown, Grey/White, Red |\n\n---\n\n### Face Ratios:\n![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/img_Face_Ratio_sec_01_03_2fe8f06b92.jpg)\n\n| **Subcategory** | **Request Parameter** | **Result Parameter** | **Result Types** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Horizontal Third Ratio | `horizontalThird` | `horizontal_third` | Three-section percentages; Interpretation: Short / Balanced / Long; Golden Ratio: 33% : 33% : 33% | The Face Horizontal Ratio is based on dividing the face into three equal sections: from the hairline to the bottom of the eyebrows, from the bottom of eyebrows to the bottom of the nose, and from the bottom of the nose to the tip of the chin. The golden ratio, or ideal proportion, between the three is 1:1:1.|\n| Vertical Fifth Ratio | `verticalFifth` | `vertical_fifth` | Five-section percentages; Interpretation (Eye Distance & Eye Width): Narrow / Balanced / Wide; Golden Ratio: 20% : 20% : 20% : 20% : 20% | The Face Vertical Ratio is determined by dividing the face into five sections: the width of one eye, the distance between the eyes, and the space between the outer corners of the eyes to the edges of the face. The golden ration for these proportions is 1:1:1:1:1. |\n| Face Aspect Ratio | `faceAspectRatio` | `face_aspect_ratio` | `[1, r]`; Interpretation: Short / Balanced / Long; Golden Ratio: 1 : 1.46 | The Face Aspect Ratio is the relationship between the width of the face and its height, ideally following the golden ratio of 1:1.46, thus creating a balanced and aesthetically pleasing appearance. |\n| Eye Aspect Ratio | `eyeAspectRatio` | `left_eye_aspect_ratio` `right_eye_aspect_ratio` | `[1, r]`; Interpretation: Round / Balanced / Flat; Golden Ratio: 1 : 3 | The Eye Aspect Ratio is the relationship between the height of the eye compared to its width, ideally aligning with the golden ratio of 1:3, ensuring the most aesthetically balanced look.\n |\n| Eyebrow Arch Ratio | `eyebrowArch` | `left_eyebrow_arch_to_eyebrow_width` `right_eyebrow_arch_to_eyebrow_width` | `[1, r]`; Interpretation: Short Arch / Balanced / Long Arch; Golden Ratio: 1 : 1.618 | The ideal proportion of the Eyebrow Arch is determined by the shape of the eyebrow itself, where the highest point (the arch) aligns with the golden ratio for an aesthetically pleasing look. |\n| Eye Height to Eyebrow Distance | `eyeHeightToEyebrowDistance` | `left_eye_height_to_eyebrow_distance` `right_eye_height_to_eyebrow_distance` `overall_eye_height_to_eyebrow_distance` | `[1, r]`; Interpretation: Short / Balanced / Long; Golden Ratio: 1 : 1.618 | The Eye to Eyebrow Distance is the vertical distance from the top of the upper eyelid to the highest point of the eyebrow. Ideally, it would follow the golden ratio of 1.618:1 when compared to the eye height, for the most harmonious balance between the eyes and the brows. |\n| Nose Aspect Ratio | `noseAspectRatio` | `nose_aspect_ratio` | `[1, r]`; Interpretation: Wide / Balanced / Narrow; Golden Ratio: 1 : 1.618 | The Nose Aspect Ratio is the relationship between the width of the nose and its height, ideally following the golden ratio of 1:1.618. |\n| Nose Width to Mouth Width | `noseWidthToMouthWidth` | `nose_width_to_mouth_width` | `[1, r]`; Interpretation: Small / Balanced / Large; Golden Ratio: 1 : 1.618 | The Nose Width to Mouth Width ratio is the relationship between the width of the nose and that of the mouth, ideally following the golden ratio of 1:1.618, creating a balanced and aesthetically pleasing appearance. |\n| Nose to Lip to Chin | `noseToLipToChin` | `nose_to_lip_to_chin` | `[1, r]`; Interpretation: Short / Balanced / Long (lower face length); Golden Ratio: 1 : 1.618 | The Nose to Lip to Chin ratio is a proportion where the distance from the base of the nose to the center of the lip is 1, and the ideal distance from the center of the lip to the chin is 1.618. This golden ratio creates a balanced and harmonious lower face, following the principles of facial symmetry. |\n| Upper Lip to Lower Lip | `upperLipToLowerLip` | `upper_lip_to_lower_lip` | `[1, r]`; Interpretation: Full Upper / Balanced / Full Lower; Golden Ratio: 1 : 1.618 | The golden ratio of the Upper Lip to the Lower Lip suggests that the thickness of the lower lip should be 1.618 times that of the upper lip. This proportion creates a balanced and aesthetically pleasing look, with the lower lip being slightly fuller than the upper lip. |\n\n----\n\n### Suggestions for How to Shoot:\n![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/strapi/assets/AI_Face_Analysis_how_to_shoot_35ca9af08e.png)\n\n> **Warning:** The width of the face needs to be greater than 60% of the width of the image.\n\n## File Specs & Errors\n### Supported Formats & Dimensions\n|AI Feature|Supported Dimensions|Supported File Size|Supported Formats|\n|  ----  | ----  | ----  | ----  |\n|AI Face Analyzer|long side <= 4096, single person only.

      "description": "### AI Hair Type Detection\nImagine having an AI hair expert in your pocket. Our tech dives into your hair's texture, thickness, and curl pattern, picking from ten unique curl shapes and sorting them into nine clear types, from Straight to Super Kinky. You get a full hair profile, and brands can use those insights to deliver spot-on product recommendations and tips just for you.\n\n## Integration Guide\n### How to Take Photos for AI Hair Type Detection\n* Take 3 Photos from left, front facing to right.\n  - Just snap three quick selfies. One facing straight ahead, one turning about 45 degrees to the left, and one turning 45 degrees to the right. We're trying to catch the full look of your hair from all sides. Make sure your whole face and the upper boundary of your hair are clearly visible in each photo. Your face should take up around 50% to 80% of the image width. Not too small, not too close. That way, it's sharp enough for analysis. When you turn for the side shots, rotate your head left and right like you're saying 'no' (that's called yaw rotation). Keep your head level with no tilting up, down, or sideways. Skip any back or top-down angles because those wont work for us.\n  - You can utilize the JS Camera Kit to snap photos. Make sure your hair is not tied up and let it hang in front of your chest. Turn your head to the right and hold still, and turn to the left to get 3 images to be analyzed.\n\n### How to Detect Hair Type by AI\n* Using the ***/s2s/v1.1/file/hair-type-detection*** API, please upload the following assets:\n  - Photos from the front, the right side, and the left side.\n\n* Execute AI task ***/s2s/v1.0/task/hair-type-detection*** </br>\nRun the hair-type detection task by sending in three images: one from the front, one from the right side, and one from the left side. Use their file IDs as the source inputs for the AI.\n\n* Polling to check the status of a task until it succeed or error</br>\nThis ***task_id*** is used to monitor the task's status through polling GET 'task/hair-type-detection' to retrieve the current engine status. Until the engine completes the task, the status will remain 'running', and no units will be consumed during this stage.\n\n## Hair Type Classification\n|Category|Thumbnail|Hair Type Classification|Description|\n|  ----  | ----  | ----  | ----  |\n|1|![](https://d3ss46vukfdtpo.cloudfront.net/static/media/img_t1.b19d4657.jpg)|Straight| This hair type is characterized by strands that lack natural curls and typically fall straight from the root to the tip|\n|2A|![](https://d3ss46vukfdtpo.cloudfront.net/static/media/img_t2A.351ef0a6.jpg)|Slight Wavy| This hair type features subtle, delicate waves with a smooth and tousled texture, but lacks volume at the roots|\n|2B|![](https://d3ss46vukfdtpo.cloudfront.net/static/media/img_t2B.daac62f4.jpg)|Medium Wavy| This hair type that showcases natural S-shaped waves that typically begin in the middle of the hair shaft and delicately hug the head, creating a subtle and sophisticated dimension|\n|2C|![](https://d3ss46vukfdtpo.cloudfront.net/static/media/img_t2C.10ef2132.jpg)|Thick Wavy|The waves in this hair type are characterized by a coarse texture and are shaped like the letter \"S\", starting at the root and continuing down the length of the hair.

width of the captured image. |\n| `height` | integer        | Pixel height of the captured image. |\n\n---\n**Notes**\n* The **number of images** varies depending on `faceDetectionMode`.\n  * Example: `\"hairfrizziness\"` and `\"hairtype\"` typically produce **three** images.\n* Image **resolution may differ** from device to device.\n  The actual pixel size depends on:\n  * The user's webcam maximum resolution\n  * The constraints and recommended settings for the selected mode\n* All images are guaranteed to meet the **minimum face quality requirements** before this event is dispatched.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration Notes\n\n**Quality Requirements**\n\n* Ensure correct distance\n* Ensure frontal face angle\n* Provide sufficient lighting (avoid shadows)\n\n**Multi-Phase Capture**\nModes like `hairtype` or `hairfrizziness` require:\n1. Front face\n2. Turn right\n3. Turn left\n\nEnsure event handling is in place.\n"

detection UI.\n\n---\n\n**`faceDetectionCaptured`**\nThis event is fired **after all required face quality validation checks have passed** and the Camera Kit has successfully completed the capture workflow.\nDepending on the selected `faceDetectionMode`, the event may contain **one or multiple captured images** (e.g., multi-angle capture for hair modes).\n\n**Callback Arguments**\n**`capturedResult`** — *Object*\nThe result object containing all successfully captured images and metadata.\n\n**Field Definitions**\n**`mode`** — *string*\nIndicates the **active faceDetectionMode** used for capturing.\nPossible values include:\n`\"skincare\" | \"hdskincare\" | \"shadefinder\" | \"hairlength\" | \"hairfrizziness\" | \"hairtype\"`\nThis value corresponds directly to the configuration set in `YMK.init({ faceDetectionMode })`.\n\n**`images`** — *Array<ImageObject>*\nA list of one or more captured images.\nEach entry represents a **single capture phase**, especially relevant for multi-phase modes (e.g., hair analysis).\n\n**ImageObject Structure**\n| Field    | Type           | Description|\n| -------- | -------------- | ---------- |\n| `phase`  | integer        | The zero-based index representing the capture step. <br> Examples: <br> • Skincare = `0` <br> • Hair frizziness sequence = `0` (front), `1` (right turn), `2` (left turn) |\n| `image`  | string or Blob | The captured image. <br> • Base64 string if `args.imageFormat = \"base64\"` <br> • Binary Blob if `args.imageFormat = \"blob\"` |\n| `width`  | integer        | Pixel width of the captured image. |\n| `height` | integer        | Pixel height of the captured image. |\n\n---\n**Notes**\n* The **number of images** varies depending on `faceDetectionMode`.\n  * Example: `\"hairfrizziness\"` and `\"hairtype\"` typically produce **three** images.\n* Image **resolution may differ** from device to device.\n  The actual pixel size depends on:\n  * The user's webcam maximum resolution\n  * The constraints and recommended settings for the selected mode\n* All images are guaranteed to meet the **minimum face quality requirements** before this event is dispatched.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration Notes\n\n**Quality Requirements**\n\n* Ensure correct distance\n* Ensure frontal face angle\n* Provide sufficient lighting (avoid shadows)\n\n**Multi-Phase Capture**\nModes like `hairtype` or `hairfrizziness` require:\n1. Front face\n2. Turn right\n3. Turn left\n\nEnsure event handling is in place.\n"

      "description": "### AI Hair Frizziness Detection\n180° Full View Hair Frizz Analysis with Just 3 Photos\n\nOur AI Frizzy Hair Analyzer delivers precise hair frizz analysis in seconds by simply uploading 3 photos—front, left, and right views of the hair.\n\nThis efficient process delivers accurate results in seconds, enabling businesses to offer tailored hair solutions and defrizz hair products based on hair frizz levels, without the need for time-consuming in-person consultations, complicated hair quizzes, or specialized hardware installations.\n![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/hair_frizzy_S_02_enu_b80c238858.jpg)\n\n## Integration Guide\n\n1. **Upload a Selfie**\n  You can provide the source image in one of two ways:\n\n  - **Use an Existing Public Image URL**\n    Instead of uploading, you may supply a publicly accessible image URL directly when initiating the AI task.\n\n  - **Upload via File API**\n    Use the endpoint:\n    ```\n    POST /v2.0/file/ai-task\n    ```\n    This returns a `file_id` for subsequent task execution.\n\n    - ***Important***: Simply calling the File API does not upload your file. You must **manually upload** the file to the **URL provided in the File API response**. That URL is your upload destination, make sure the file is successfully transferred there before proceeding.<br></br>\n    Before calling the AI API, ensure your file has been successfully uploaded. Use the File API to retrieve an upload URL, then upload your file to that location. Once the upload is complete, you'll receive a ***file_id*** in the response, this ID is what you'll use to access AI features related to that file.\n\n      > **Warning:** Please note that, you will get an 500 Server Error / unknown_internal_error or 404 Not Found error when using AI APIs if you do not upload the file to the URL provided in the File API response.\n\n2.  **List Predefined Styles**\n    *   Use /v2.0/task/template/ai-task to fetch a predefined template list and select a ``template_id`` to run an AI task.\n\n3.  **Run an AI Task to Obtain a Task ID**\n    Execute the AI task using /v2.0/task/ai-task. For the target user image, provide either ``src_file_url`` or ``src_file_id``. And a stype ``template_id`` to apply and obtain a ``task_id``.\n\n4.  **Poll to Check the Status of a Task Until It Succeeds or Fails**\n    Use the ``task_id`` to monitor the task status by polling GET /v2.0/task/ai-task to retrieve the current engine status. Until the engine completes the task, the status will remain as running, and no units will be consumed during this stage.\n    You can also implement a webhook to receive notifications when an AI task succeeds or fails. Refer to the **[Webhook](#tag/Webhook)** section for details.\n\n    > **Warning:** Polling to check the status of a task within its retention period is mandatory. A task will time out if there is no polling request within the retention period, even if the task is processed successfully. Your units will still be consumed.\n\n    > **Warning:** You will receive an InvalidTaskId error if you check the status of a timed-out task. Therefore, once you run an AI task, you must poll to check the status within the retention period until the status becomes either success or error.\n\n5.  **Retrieve the Result of an AI Task Once Successful**\n    The task status will change to success after the engine processes your input file and generates the resulting image. You will receive a URL for the processed image.\n\n## Inputs & Outputs\n### Input format\n![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/hair_frizzy_step_01_ac5c651ea4.png)\nUpload 3 photos - front, left, and right views of the hair.\nYou can utilize the JS Camera Kit to implement a Javascript camera module to take 3 qualified photos.\n\n\n### Output format\nAI Frizzy Hair Analyzer assesses hair types and identifies 4 distinct degrees of hair frizz - from smooth hair to extremely frizzy hair, offering precise insights into hair frizz condition.\n\n| **Mapping (0–3)** | **Term**            | **Description**                                           |\n| ----------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 0             | Not Frizzy      | Hair appears smooth with minimal or no visible frizz.     |\n| 1            | Slightly Frizzy | Light frizz visible; mild surface texture irregularities. |\n| 2             | Frizzy         | Noticeable frizz across hair; clear texture disruption.   |\n| 3             | Extreme Frizzy  | Strong, widespread frizz; highly irregular hair texture.  |\n\n![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/hair_frizzy_S_01_enu_fcd10905ff.jpg)\n\n### Sample Output\n```json\n{\n  \"mapping\": 1, // number; the key to map of result, alternatives: [0, 1, 2, 3]\n  \"term\": \"Slightly Frizzy\" // string; 1-1 map to the \"mapping\", alternatives: [\"Not Frizzy\", \"Slightly Frizzy\", \"Frizzy\", \"Extreme Frizzy\"]\n}\n```\n\n## File Specs & Errors\n### Supported Formats & Dimensions\n|Type|Supported Dimensions|Supported File Size|Supported Formats|\n|  ----  | ----  | ----  | ----  |\n|AI Hair Frizziness Detection|The image must be at least 100 pixels wide and tall, and no more than 4096 pixels in either dimension.

function() {\n    YMK.init(); // default settings\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\nAdditional requirements:\n\n| Requirement             | Description                                 |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |\n| Browser                 | Must support `getUserMedia`                 |\n| HTTPS                   | Required on most browsers for webcam access |\n| `<div id=\"YMK-module\">` | Mandatory mount point for the UI            |\n\n---\n\n### Integration Guide\n\n#### Step 1 — Initialize the Module\n\nCall `YMK.init()` before calling `YMK.openCameraKit()`:\n\n```javascript\nYMK.init({\n  faceDetectionMode: 'skincare',\n  imageFormat: 'base64',\n  language: 'enu'\n});\n```\n\n##### Supported Detection Modes\n\n| Mode             | Description                                               |\n| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `makeup`         | Standard camera mode for virtual cosmetic try-on |\n| `skincare`       | Standard skin analysis mode, close-up face capture        |\n| `hdskincare`     | HD Skin capture using webcams with ≥ 2560px width |\n| `shadefinder`    | Skin Tone Analysis front-face capture                           |\n| `hairlength`     | Full hair-length capture (from a distance)                |\n| `hairfrizziness` | 3-phase

examples:\n\n```javascript\nYMK.addEventListener('faceQualityChanged', function(q) {\n  console.log('Quality updated:', q);\n});\n```\n\nSee the full Events List below.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 3 — Open Camera Kit\n\n```javascript\nYMK.openCameraKit();\n```\n\nThis automatically:\n\n* Shows the UI\n* Opens webcam\n* Begins real-time face quality monitoring\n* Automatically captures when conditions are acceptable\n\n---\n\n#### Step 4 — Receiving Captured Result\n\nCaptured images arrive via:\n\n```javascript\nYMK.addEventListener('faceDetectionCaptured', function(result) {\n  console.log(result.images);\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n#### Step 5 — Close Module\n\n```javascript\nYMK.close();\n```\n\n---\n\n### API Reference\n\n---\n\n**`YMK.init(args)`**\n\nConfigures module

You must **manually upload** the file to the **URL provided in the File API response**. That URL is your upload destination, make sure the file is successfully transferred there before proceeding.<br></br>\n    Before calling the AI API, ensure your file has been successfully uploaded. Use the File API to retrieve an upload URL, then upload your file to that location. Once the upload is complete, you'll receive a ***file_id*** in the response, this ID is what you'll use to access AI features related to that file.\n\n      > **Warning:** Please note that, you will get an 500 Server Error / unknown_internal_error or 404 Not Found error when using AI APIs if you do not upload the file to the URL provided in the File API response.\n\n2.  **List Predefined Styles**\n    *   Use /v2.0/task/template/ai-task to fetch a predefined template list and select a ``template_id`` to run an AI task.\n\n3.  **Run an AI Task to Obtain a Task ID**\n    Execute the AI task using /v2.0/task/ai-task. For the target user image, provide either ``src_file_url`` or ``src_file_id``. And a stype ``template_id`` to apply and obtain a ``task_id``.\n\n4.  **Poll to Check the Status of a Task Until It Succeeds or Fails**\n    Use the ``task_id`` to monitor the task status by polling GET /v2.0/task/ai-task to retrieve the current engine status. Until the engine completes the task, the status will remain as running, and no units will be consumed during this stage.\n    You can also implement a webhook to receive notifications when an AI task succeeds or fails. Refer to the **[Webhook](#tag/Webhook)** section for details.\n\n    > **Warning:** Polling to check the status of a task within its retention period is mandatory. A task will time out if there is no polling request within the retention period, even if the task is processed successfully. Your units will still be consumed.\n\n    > **Warning:** You will receive an InvalidTaskId error if you check the status of a timed-out task. Therefore, once you run an AI task, you must poll to check the status within the retention period until the status becomes either success or error.\n\n5.  **Retrieve the Result of an AI Task Once Successful**\n    The task status will change to success after the engine processes your input file and generates the resulting image. You will receive a URL for the processed image.\n\n---\n\n## File Specs & Errors\n### Supported Formats & Dimensions\n|AI Feature|Supported Dimensions|Supported File Size|Supported Formats|\n|  ----  | ----  | ----  | ----  |\n|AI Beardstyle Generator|Resolution: Long side < 1024 <br>face width > 256 <br>face pose: -30 < yaw < 30, <br>single face only, <br>need to show full face|< 10MB|jpg/jpeg|\n\n### Error Codes\n|Error Code|Description|\n|  ----  | ----  |\n|error_no_face\t|Face are not visible in the source image\n|error_src_face_too_small\t|The face is too small\n|error_inference\t|Beard removal error or beard generation error\n|error_face_pose\t|The face pose of source image is unsupported\n\n### Environment & Dependency\n| Sample Code Language / Tool | Recommended Runtime Versions |\n|---|---|\n| cURL | - bash >= 3.2</br>   - curl >= 7.58 (modern TLS/HTTP support)</br>   - jq >= 1.6 (robust JSON parsing) |\n| Node.js (JavaScript) | Node >= 18 (for global fetch) |\n| JavaScript | - Chrome / Edge >= 80</br>   - Firefox >= 74</br>   - Safari >= 13.1 |\n| PHP | PHP >= 7.4 (for modern TLS/compat), ext-curl (recommended) or allow_url_fopen=On + ext-openssl, ext-json |\n| Python | Python >= 3.10 (for f-strings), requests >= 2.20.0 |\n| Java | Java 11+ (for HttpClient), Jackson Databind >= 2.12.0 |\n\n---\n"

Recommended Quality**\n\n```javascript\nconst minQuality = {\n  hasFace: true,\n  area: \"good\",\n  frontal: \"good\",\n  lighting: \"ok\"\n};\n```\n\n---\n\n**`faceDetectionStarted`**\nUser enters detection UI.\n\n---\n\n**`faceDetectionCaptured`**\nThis event is fired **after all required face quality validation checks have passed** and the Camera Kit has successfully completed the capture workflow.\nDepending on the selected `faceDetectionMode`, the event may contain **one or multiple captured images** (e.g., multi-angle capture for hair modes).\n\n**Callback Arguments**\n**`capturedResult`** — *Object*\nThe result object containing all successfully captured images and metadata.\n\n**Field Definitions**\n**`mode`** — *string*\nIndicates the **active faceDetectionMode** used for capturing.\nPossible values include:\n`\"skincare\" | \"hdskincare\" | \"shadefinder\" | \"hairlength\" | \"hairfrizziness\" | \"hairtype\"`\nThis value corresponds directly to the configuration set in `YMK.init({ faceDetectionMode })`.\n\n**`images`** — *Array<ImageObject>*\nA list of one or more captured images.\nEach entry represents a **single capture phase**, especially relevant for multi-phase modes (e.g., hair analysis).\n\n**ImageObject Structure**\n| Field    | Type           | Description|\n| -------- | -------------- | ---------- |\n| `phase`  | integer        | The zero-based index representing the capture step. <br> Examples: <br> • Skincare = `0` <br> • Hair frizziness sequence = `0` (front), `1` (right turn), `2` (left turn) |\n| `image`  | string or Blob | The captured image. <br> • Base64 string if `args.imageFormat = \"base64\"` <br> • Binary Blob if `args.imageFormat = \"blob\"` |\n| `width`  | integer        | Pixel width of the captured image. |\n| `height` | integer        | Pixel height of the captured image. |\n\n---\n**Notes**\n* The **number of images** varies depending on `faceDetectionMode`.\n  * Example: `\"hairfrizziness\"` and `\"hairtype\"` typically produce **three** images.\n* Image **resolution may differ** from device to device.\n  The actual pixel size depends on:\n  * The user's webcam maximum resolution\n  * The constraints and recommended settings for the selected mode\n* All images are guaranteed to meet the **minimum face quality requirements** before this event is dispatched.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration Notes\n\n**Quality Requirements**\n\n* Ensure correct distance\n* Ensure frontal face angle\n* Provide sufficient lighting (avoid shadows)\n\n**Multi-Phase Capture**\nModes like `hairtype` or `hairfrizziness` require:\n1. Front face\n2. Turn right\n3. Turn left\n\nEnsure event handling is in place.\n"

Once the upload is complete, you'll receive a ***file_id*** in the response, this ID is what you'll use to access AI features related to that file.\n\n      > **Warning:** Please note that, you will get an 500 Server Error / unknown_internal_error or 404 Not Found error when using AI APIs if you do not upload the file to the URL provided in the File API response.\n\n3. **Run an AI Face Skin Tone Analysis task**</br>\n  Once your upload is complete, the AI will use your file ID to examine the color tones of your lips, eyes, eyebrows, skin, and hair. Please refer to the **[Inputs & Outputs](#tag/AI-Skin-Tone-Analysis/Inputs-and-Outputs)**.</br>\n  Subsequently, calling POST 'task/face-attr-analysis' with the\n  File ID executes the enhance task and obtains a ***task_id***.\n\n4. **Polling to check the status of a task until it succeed or error**</BR>\nThis ***task_id*** is used to monitor the task's status through polling GET 'task/face-attr-analysis' to retrieve the current engine status. Until the engine completes the task, the status will remain 'running', and no units will be consumed during this stage.\n\n    **Warning:** Please note that, **Polling** to check the status of a task based on it's retention period is mandotary. A task will be timed out if there is no polling request within the retention period, even if the task is processed succefully(Your unit(s) will be consumed).\n\n    > **Warning:** You will get a ***InvalidTaskId*** error once you check the status of a timed out task. So, once you run an AI task, you need to **polling** to check the status within the retention period until the status become either *success* or *error*.\n\n5. **Get the result of an AI task once success**</BR>\nThe task will change to the 'success' status after the engine successfully processes your input file and generates the resulting image. You will get an url of the processed image and a dst_id that allow you to chain another AI task without re-upload the result image.\nYour units will only be consumed in this case. If the engine fails to process the task, the task's status will change to 'error' and no unit will be consumed.</BR>\nWhen deducting units, the system will prioritize those nearing expiration. If the expiration date is the same, it will deduct the units obtained on the earliest date.\n\n### Real-world examples:\n![](https://plugins-media.makeupar.com/smb/blog/post/2025-01-15/10a4b980-f571-4d08-8f5d-e3ed48db77aa.jpg)\n\n## Inputs & Outputs\n### Inputs\nThe AI will analyse the color tones of your skin. You may adjust the `face_angle_strictness_level` to control the checking strictness of the input face angle, ranging from strict, high, medium, low to flexible. The strictness level applies to face angle detection, including pitch, yaw and roll. A stricter level ensures more accurate face attribute results. The default setting is high.\n\n### Outputs\n```json\n{\n    \"skin_color\": \"#b28e73\"\n}\n```\n\n### Suggestions for How to Shoot:\n![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/strapi/assets/webp_AI%20Skin%20Analysis_camera_f93315b088.png)\n\n> **Warning:** The width of the face needs to be greater than 60% of the width of the image.\n\n## File Specs & Errors\n### Supported Formats & Dimensions\n|AI Feature|Supported Dimensions|Supported File Size|Supported Formats|\n|  ----  | ----  | ----  | ----  |\n|AI Face Skin Tone Analysis|long side <= 4096, single person only.

Recommended Quality**\n\n```javascript\nconst minQuality = {\n  hasFace: true,\n  area: \"good\",\n  frontal: \"good\",\n  lighting: \"ok\"\n};\n```\n\n---\n\n**`faceDetectionStarted`**\nUser enters detection UI.\n\n---\n\n**`faceDetectionCaptured`**\nThis event is fired **after all required face quality validation checks have passed** and the Camera Kit has successfully completed the capture workflow.\nDepending on the selected `faceDetectionMode`, the event may contain **one or multiple captured images** (e.g., multi-angle capture for hair modes).\n\n**Callback Arguments**\n**`capturedResult`** — *Object*\nThe result object containing all successfully captured images and metadata.\n\n**Field Definitions**\n**`mode`** — *string*\nIndicates the **active faceDetectionMode** used for capturing.\nPossible values include:\n`\"skincare\" | \"hdskincare\" | \"shadefinder\" | \"hairlength\" | \"hairfrizziness\" | \"hairtype\"`\nThis value corresponds directly to the configuration set in `YMK.init({ faceDetectionMode })`.\n\n**`images`** — *Array<ImageObject>*\nA list of one or more captured images.\nEach entry represents a **single capture phase**, especially relevant for multi-phase modes (e.g., hair analysis).\n\n**ImageObject Structure**\n| Field    | Type           | Description|\n| -------- | -------------- | ---------- |\n| `phase`  | integer        | The zero-based index representing the capture step. <br> Examples: <br> • Skincare = `0` <br> • Hair frizziness sequence = `0` (front), `1` (right turn), `2` (left turn) |\n| `image`  | string or Blob | The captured image. <br> • Base64 string if `args.imageFormat = \"base64\"` <br> • Binary Blob if `args.imageFormat = \"blob\"` |\n| `width`  | integer        | Pixel width of the captured image. |\n| `height` | integer        | Pixel height of the captured image. |\n\n---\n**Notes**\n* The **number of images** varies depending on `faceDetectionMode`.\n  * Example: `\"hairfrizziness\"` and `\"hairtype\"` typically produce **three** images.\n* Image **resolution may differ** from device to device.\n  The actual pixel size depends on:\n  * The user's webcam maximum resolution\n  * The constraints and recommended settings for the selected mode\n* All images are guaranteed to meet the **minimum face quality requirements** before this event is dispatched.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration Notes\n\n**Quality Requirements**\n\n* Ensure correct distance\n* Ensure frontal face angle\n* Provide sufficient lighting (avoid shadows)\n\n**Multi-Phase Capture**\nModes like `hairtype` or `hairfrizziness` require:\n1. Front face\n2. Turn right\n3. Turn left\n\nEnsure event handling is in place.\n"

      "description": "### **AI Makeup Virtual Try-On API Documentation**\nThe AI Makeup API provides a powerful, hyper-realistic virtual makeover experience powered by our patented face-analyzing technology. This service enables your applications to apply true-to-life makeup effects onto user-provided selfie images with unprecedented customization capabilities.\n\n**Key Features:**\n*   **Hyper-realistic Rendering:** Leverages revolutionary 3D face AI technology for the most realistic makeovers.\n*   **Patented Technology:** Powered by jitter-free, lag-free deep learning algorithms optimized for all ages and ethnicities.\n*   **Real-time Precision:** Ultra-precise facial tracking that adapts to various lighting conditions.\n*   **True-to-life Matching:** Accurately matches real-world product colors, textures (from matte to metallic), and finishes.\n\n### Core Concepts\n\n#### Color Blending\nOur AI accurately matches the color of real-life makeup products using deep learning. This ensures consumers are confident that the virtual color they see is the true color of the product they intend to purchase.\n\n#### Texture & Finish Matching\nThe technology simulates realistic textures and finishes, providing a highly accurate makeover experience. From matte to metallic, shimmer to satin, the AI taps into advanced algorithms to render these effects seamlessly in real-time.\n\n#### Light Balancing\nThe smart 3D AI engine detects lighting conditions in the user's photo or video feed. It corrects images for true-to-life makeup application, ensuring a consistent and high-quality result regardless of the environment.\n\n---\n\n## Integration Guide\n\nThe Makeup Virtual Try-On service operates as an asynchronous task. You must first initiate a makeup processing task by providing the image URL and a list of desired effects. The server responds with a `task_id`. You then periodically poll a status endpoint to retrieve the final result or any errors.\n\n*   **Endpoint:** `/v2.0/task/makeup-vto`\n*   **Authentication:** All requests require an `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>`\n*   **Workflow:**\n    1.  **Prepare a selfie:** Upload an image or use existing file url of a face image.\n    1.  **Start Task (`POST`):** Submit your image id/URL and makeup configuration.\n    1.  **Retrieve Task ID:** Capture the `task_id` from the response.\n    1.  **Poll Status (`GET`):** Use the `task_id` to check the status of the task. Continue polling until `task_status` is `\"success\"` or `\"error\"`.\n\n\n### API Playground\n\nInteractively explore and test the API using our official playground:\n\n**API Playground:**\n[http://yce.makeupar.com/api-console/en/api-playground/ai-makeup-virtual-try-on/](http://yce.makeupar.com/api-console/en/api-playground/ai-makeup-virtual-try-on/)\n\n---\n\n### Authentication\n- Include your API key in the request header using **Bearer Token**:\n    ```\n    Authorization: Bearer <API Key>\n    ```\nYou can find your API Key at https://yce.makeupar.com/api-console/en/api-keys/.\n\n### 1. Upload a Selfie\n  You can provide the source image in one of two ways:\n\n  - **Use an Existing Public Image URL**\n    Instead of uploading, you may supply a publicly accessible image URL directly when initiating the AI task.\n\n  - **Upload via File API**\n    Use the endpoint:\n    ```\n    POST /v2.0/file/makeup-vto\n    ```\n    This returns a `file_id` for subsequent task execution.\n\n    - ***Important***: Simply calling the File API does not upload your file. You must **manually upload** the file to the **URL provided in the File API response**. That URL is your upload destination, make sure the file is successfully transferred there before proceeding.<br></br>\n    Before calling the AI API, ensure your file has been successfully uploaded. Use the File API to retrieve an upload URL, then upload your file to that location. Once the upload is complete, you'll receive a ***file_id*** in the response, this ID is what you'll use to access AI features related to that file.\n\n      > **Warning:** Please note that, you will get an 500 Server Error / unknown_internal_error or 404 Not Found error when using AI APIs if you do not upload the file to the URL provided in the File API response.\n\n\n### 2. Start Makeup Task\n\n`POST /v2.0/task/makeup-vto`\n\nInitiates a new virtual makeup task on the provided image. This endpoint is asynchronous and returns with a `task_id`.\n\n#### Request Headers\n| Header | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Content-Type | `application/json` |\n| Authorization | `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` |\n\n#### Example Request Body\n```json\n{\n  \"src_file_url\": \"https://plugins-media.makeupar.com/strapi/assets/sample_Image_1_202b6bf6e6.jpg\",\n  \"effects\": [\n    {\n      \"category\": \"blush\",\n      \"pattern\": { \"name\": \"2colors6\" },\n      \"palettes\": [\n        { \"color\": \"#FF0000\", \"texture\": \"matte\", \"colorIntensity\": 50 },\n        { \"color\": \"#F2A53E\", \"texture\": \"matte\", \"colorIntensity\": 50 }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"category\": \"eye_liner\",\n      \"pattern\": { \"name\": \"3colors5\" },\n      \"palettes\": [\n        { \"color\": \"#000000\", \"texture\": \"matte\", \"colorIntensity\": 50 },\n        { \"color\": \"#BA0656\", \"texture\": \"matte\", \"colorIntensity\": 50 },\n        { \"color\": \"#089085\", \"texture\": \"matte\", \"colorIntensity\": 50 }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"version\": \"1.0\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Request Body Schema\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|---------|\n| `src_file_url` | string (URL) | A publicly accessible URL to the selfie image to be processed. |\n| `effects` | array<Effect> | An array of makeup effects objects to apply.

example, `blush` uses the the `2colors1` pattern from the `blush.json`, which requires exactly two palettes. The `lip_color` effect uses the the `plump` shape from `lipshape.json`.\n\n## File Specs & Errors\n### Supported Formats & Dimensions\n|AI Feature|Supported Dimensions|Supported File Size|Supported Formats|\n|  ----  | ----  | ----  | ----  |\n|AI Makeup Virtual Try-On|long side < 1920, face width >= 100|< 10MB|jpg/jpeg/png|\n\n### Error Codes\n|Error Code|Description|\n|  ----  | ----  |\n|error_below_min_image_size|the size of the source image is smaller than minimum (expect: width >= 100px, height >= 100px)\n|error_exceed_max_image_size|the size of the source image is larger than maximum (expect: width < 1920px, height < 1080px)\n|error_face_position_invalid |Please ensure your entire face is fully visible within the image|\n|error_face_position_too_small|The detected face is too small.

It includes:\n\n* Camera permission handling\n* Real-time face detection\n* Automatic face quality validation (lighting, pose, angle, distance)\n* Guided capture UI\n* Multi-step capture flows for advanced hair/face tasks\n* Support for both **base64** and **blob** output formats\n\nThe module is particularly optimized for **AI-driven image analysis**, such as AI Skin Analysis (SD/HD), AI Face Tone Analysis, and hair-related analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Download the JS Camera Kit\nInclude the JS Camera Kit SDK via CDN:\n\n```\nhttps://plugins-media.makeupar.com/v2.1-camera-kit/sdk.js\n```\n\nOnce loaded, the SDK installs a global `YMK` object.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Start Example\n\nThe following sample demonstrates:\n\n* Loading the JS Camera Kit SDK\n* Implementing `window.ymkAsyncInit`\n* Initializing the module\n* Opening the camera\n* Receiving captured images\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html

YMK.addEventListener('faceDetectionCaptured', function(capturedResult) {\n          /* Display all captured images */\n          const container = document.getElementById('captured-results');\n          container.innerHTML = '';\n\n          for (const image of capturedResult.images) {\n            const img = document.createElement('img');\n            img.src = typeof image.image === 'string'\n              ? image.image\n              : URL.createObjectURL(image.image);\n\n            container.appendChild(img);\n          }\n        });\n      };\n\n      function openCameraKit() {\n        YMK.init({\n          faceDetectionMode: 'skincare',\n          imageFormat: 'base64',\n          language: 'enu',\n        });\n        YMK.openCameraKit();\n      }\n    </script>\n\n    <!-- Load SDK -->\n    <script>\n      window.addEventListener('load', function() {\n        (function(d) {\n          const s = d.createElement('script');\n          s.type = 'text/javascript';\n          s.async = true;\n          s.src = 'https://plugins-media.makeupar.com/v2.1-camera-kit/sdk.js';\n          d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0].parentNode.insertBefore(s, null);\n

id=\"captured-results\"></div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n---\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nYou must define the asynchronous initialization entry point:\n\n```html\n<script>\n  window.ymkAsyncInit = function() {\n    YMK.init(); // default settings\n  };\n</script>\n```\n\nAdditional requirements:\n\n| Requirement             | Description                                 |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |\n| Browser                 | Must support `getUserMedia`                 |\n| HTTPS                   | Required on most browsers for webcam access |\n| `<div id=\"YMK-module\">` | Mandatory mount point for the UI            |\n\n---\n\n### Integration Guide\n\n#### Step 1 — Initialize the Module\n\nCall `YMK.init()` before calling `YMK.openCameraKit()`:\n\n```javascript\nYMK.init({\n  faceDetectionMode: 'skincare',\n  imageFormat: 'base64',\n  language: 'enu'\n});\n```\n\n##### Supported Detection Modes\n\n| Mode             | Description                                               |\n| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `makeup`         | Standard camera mode for virtual cosmetic try-on |\n| `skincare`       | Standard skin analysis mode, close-up face capture        |\n| `hdskincare`     | HD Skin capture using webcams with ≥ 2560px width |\n| `shadefinder`    | Skin Tone Analysis front-face capture                           |\n| `hairlength`     | Full hair-length capture (from a distance)                |\n| `hairfrizziness` | 3-phase

`\"error_access_failed\"`|\n\n---\n\n\n**`faceQualityChanged`**\n\nFires continuously during detection.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hasFace\": true,\n  \"area\": \"good\",\n  \"frontal\": \"good\",\n  \"lighting\": \"ok\",\n  \"nakedeye\": \"good\",\n  \"faceangle\": \"good\"\n}\n```\n\n* Field Descriptions\n\n| Field       | Values | Meaning                        |\n| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------ |\n| `hasFace`   | `true/false`| Whether face is detected|\n| `area`      | `\"good\"`, `\"notgood\"`, `\"toosmall\"`, `\"outofboundary\"`| Face distance/size quality|\n| `frontal`   | `\"good\"`, `\"notgood\"`| Whether user is facing forward|\n| `lighting`  | `\"good\"`, `\"ok\"`, `\"notgood\"`| Lighting strength|\n| `nakedeye`  | `\"good\"`, `\"notgood\"`| Eyewear detection|\n| `faceangle` | `\"good\"`, `\"upward\"`, `\"downward\"`, `\"leftward\"`, `\"rightward\"`, `\"lefttilt\"`, `\"righttilt\"` | Face orientation|\n\n---\n\n**Minimum Recommended Quality**\n\n```javascript\nconst minQuality = {\n  hasFace: true,\n  area: \"good\",\n  frontal: \"good\",\n  lighting: \"ok\"\n};\n```\n\n---\n\n**`faceDetectionStarted`**\nUser enters detection UI.\n\n---\n\n**`faceDetectionCaptured`**\nThis event is fired **after all required face quality validation checks have passed** and the Camera Kit has successfully completed the capture workflow.\nDepending on the selected `faceDetectionMode`, the event may contain **one or multiple captured images** (e.g., multi-angle capture for hair modes).\n\n**Callback Arguments**\n**`capturedResult`** — *Object*\nThe result object containing all successfully captured images and metadata.\n\n**Field Definitions**\n**`mode`** — *string*\nIndicates the **active faceDetectionMode** used for capturing.\nPossible values include:\n`\"skincare\" | \"hdskincare\" | \"shadefinder\" | \"hairlength\" | \"hairfrizziness\" | \"hairtype\"`\nThis value corresponds directly to the configuration set in `YMK.init({ faceDetectionMode })`.\n\n**`images`** — *Array<ImageObject>*\nA list of one or more captured images.\nEach entry represents a **single capture phase**, especially relevant for multi-phase modes (e.g., hair analysis).\n\n**ImageObject Structure**\n| Field    | Type           | Description|\n| -------- | -------------- | ---------- |\n| `phase`  | integer        | The zero-based index representing the capture step. <br> Examples: <br> • Skincare = `0` <br> • Hair frizziness sequence = `0` (front), `1` (right turn), `2` (left turn) |\n| `image`  | string or Blob | The captured image. <br> • Base64 string if `args.imageFormat = \"base64\"` <br> • Binary Blob if `args.imageFormat = \"blob\"` |\n| `width`  | integer        | Pixel width of the captured image. |\n| `height` | integer        | Pixel height of the captured image. |\n\n---\n**Notes**\n* The **number of images** varies depending on `faceDetectionMode`.\n  * Example: `\"hairfrizziness\"` and `\"hairtype\"` typically produce **three** images.\n* Image **resolution may differ** from device to device.\n  The actual pixel size depends on:\n  * The user's webcam maximum resolution\n  * The constraints and recommended settings for the selected mode\n* All images are guaranteed to meet the **minimum face quality requirements** before this event is dispatched.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration Notes\n\n**Quality Requirements**\n\n* Ensure correct distance\n* Ensure frontal face angle\n* Provide sufficient lighting (avoid shadows)\n\n**Multi-Phase Capture**\nModes like `hairtype` or `hairfrizziness` require:\n1. Front face\n2. Turn right\n3. Turn left\n\nEnsure event handling is in place.\n"

Notifications are sent to an HTTP endpoint you control and follow the [Standard Webhooks Specification](https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/blob/main/spec/standard-webhooks.md).\n\n---\n\n#### Webhook Secret\n\n##### Construction of Webhook Secret\n\nWe use **HMAC-SHA256** signature schme webhook secret, and webhook secret is base64 encoded, prefixed with `whsec_` for easy identification.\n\nExample webhook secret:\n\n```whsec_NDQzMzYxNzkzMzE0NjYyNDM6OTIxOTcwNDIxODQ```\n\n##### Implement Webhook with Standard Webhooks Library\n\nWe strongly recommend using an official implementation of the **Standard Webhooks Library**, and you do not have to worry about the signature validation details.\n\nUsing an official implementation also ensures secure and correct signature validation.\n\n**[https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#reference-implementations](https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#reference-implementations)**\n\n##### Implement Webhook by Yourself\n\nPlease carefully understand the construction of the webhook secret, refer to Symmetric part of [Signature scheme](https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/blob/main/spec/standard-webhooks.md#signature-scheme).\n\nWhen you are trying to sign signature input, please remove the `whsec_` prefix and base64 decode the remaining string to obtain the actual bytes of secret to do **HMAC-SHA256** hash.\n\n---\n\n#### Webhook Request Example\n\n```http\nPOST https://yourdomain.com/webhook-endpoint\nContent-Type: application/json\nwebhook-id: msg_1eWPv9cWJCnEP99UJncmVJ6KjK_xVXRhZPe_eSGnRNbLlXEPjiG3gb3Usg9le3_4:1761112848\nwebhook-timestamp: 1761112900\nwebhook-signature: v1,vyVNWrjoZcBK1JXrFGkdDKK2slo5+Q5yfzpkHmqO5R0=\n```\n```json\n{\n  \"created_at\": 1761112848,\n  \"data\": {\n    \"task_id\": \"1eWPv9cWJCnEP99UJncmVJ6KjK_xVXRhZPe_eSGnRNbLlXEPjiG3gb3Usg9le3_4\",\n    \"task_status\": \"success\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n#### HTTP Headers\n\n##### `webhook-id`\n\nA unique identifier for the webhook delivery.\nThis value remains consistent across retries and should be used for idempotency handling.\n\n##### `webhook-timestamp`\n\nThe Unix epoch timestamp (seconds) when the webhook was sent.\n\n##### `webhook-signature`\n\n'v1' followed by a comma (,), followed by the base64 encoded **HMAC-SHA256** signature.\n\n'v1' indicates the version of the signature scheme, and is currently the only supported version.\n\nThe base64 encoded **HMAC-SHA256** signature is the result of signing signature input using your webhook secret.\n\nSignature input format:\n\n```\n{webhook-id}.{webhook-timestamp}.{raw-minified-json-body}\n```\n\n**Example signed content:**\n\n```\nmsg_1eWPv9cWJCnEP99UJncmVJ6KjK_xVXRhZPe_eSGnRNbLlXEPjiG3gb3Usg9le3_4:1761112848.1761112900.{\"created_at\":1761112848,\"data\":{\"task_id\":\"1eWPv9cWJCnEP99UJncmVJ6KjK_xVXRhZPe_eSGnRNbLlXEPjiG3gb3Usg9le3_4\",\"task_status\":\"success\"}}\n```\n\n---\n\n#### Request Body\n\n##### `created_at`\n\nUnix epoch timestamp (seconds) indicating when the task completed.\n\n##### `data`\n\nContains the event payload.\n\n| Field         | Description                                                                                         |\n| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `task_id`     | The task identifier returned when the task was created. Use this ID to query the final task result. |\n| `task_status` | Task completion status. Possible values: `success`, `error`.                                        |\n\n---\n\n### Webhook Integration Guide\n\n1. **Prepare a webhook endpoint on your server.**\n   Ensure the endpoint accepts `POST` requests and is accessible via HTTPS.\n\n2. **Create a webhook in the API Console.**\n\n3. **Run an AI task and record the `task_id`.**\n\n4. **Process webhook notifications using the `task_id` to retrieve task results.**\n\n---\n\n#### Creating a Webhook Endpoint\n\nVisit the API Console's Webhook Management page:\n\n**[https://yce.makeupar.com/api-console/en/webhook/](https://yce.makeupar.com/api-console/en/webhook/)**\n\n##### 1. Locate the Webhook Section\n\n![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/strapi/assets/webhook_main_bae171663b.png)\n\n##### 2. Create a New Webhook Endpoint\n\n![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/strapi/assets/webhook_create_cd28e68fa3.png)\n\nYou may configure up to **10 webhook endpoints** concurrently.\n\n##### 3. Secure Your Webhook Secret\n\nYour webhook secret is used to validate the `webhook-signature`.\nKeep it safe and never expose it publicly.\n\n![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/strapi/assets/webhook_secret_key_6fe757a7de.png)\n\n##### 4. Manage Existing Webhooks\n\n![](https://bcw-media.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/strapi/assets/webhook_manage_endpoints_3bed715de9.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Handling Webhook Requests on Your Server\n\nWe recommend using an official implementation of the **Standard Webhooks Library**:\n\n**[https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#reference-implementations](https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#reference-implementations)**\n\nThis ensures secure and correct signature validation.\n\nYou can also test or debug payloads using the **Standard Webhooks Simulator**:\n\n**[https://www.standardwebhooks.com/simulate](https://www.standardwebhooks.com/simulate)**\n\n#### Verifying Webhook Signatures\nConsider the webhook request example:\n```http\nPOST https://yourdomain.com/webhook-endpoint\nContent-Type: application/json\nwebhook-id: msg_1eWPv9cWJCnEP99UJncmVJ6KjK_xVXRhZPe_eSGnRNbLlXEPjiG3gb3Usg9le3_4:1761112848\nwebhook-timestamp: 1761112900\nwebhook-signature: v1,vyVNWrjoZcBK1JXrFGkdDKK2slo5+Q5yfzpkHmqO5R0=\n```\nRequest body:\n```json\n{\n  \"created_at\": 1761112848,\n  \"data\": {\n    \"task_id\": \"1eWPv9cWJCnEP99UJncmVJ6KjK_xVXRhZPe_eSGnRNbLlXEPjiG3gb3Usg9le3_4\",\n    \"task_status\": \"success\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSignature input format will be like:\n```\n{webhook-id}.{webhook-timestamp}.{raw-minified-json-body}\n```\n\nExample signed content:\n```\nmsg_1eWPv9cWJCnEP99UJncmVJ6KjK_xVXRhZPe_eSGnRNbLlXEPjiG3gb3Usg9le3_4:1761112848.1761112900.{\"created_at\":1761112848,\"data\":{\"task_id\":\"1eWPv9cWJCnEP99UJncmVJ6KjK_xVXRhZPe_eSGnRNbLlXEPjiG3gb3Usg9le3_4\",\"task_status\":\"success\"}}\n```\n\nVeriry HMAC-SHA256 encrypted signed content using your webhook secret key with the received webhook-signature.\nExample:\n```\nv1,vyVNWrjoZcBK1JXrFGkdDKK2slo5+Q5yfzpkHmqO5R0=\n```\n"
